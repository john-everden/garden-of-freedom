# Meta‑Strategies  
### Strategies of Cross‑Layer Harmony & Systemic Insight

---

## Overview
Meta‑Strategies govern how the Garden’s layers interact.  
They ensure that Modes, Connectors, Currents, and Protocols operate in harmony.

**Essence:** *The strategy behind strategies.*

## Core Principles

### 1. Cross‑Layer Alignment
- Ensure Modes, Connectors, Currents, and Protocols reinforce each other.  
- Prevent contradictions or misalignment.

### 2. Harmonic Reasoning
- Use Resonance to amplify coherence.  
- Use Convergence to unify patterns.

### 3. Adaptive Integration
- Adjust strategies based on context, cycles, and contributors.  
- Maintain flexibility without losing structure.
