# Flow (~>)  
### Strategy of Directional Motion & Living Continuity

---

## Overview
Flow is the Garden’s strategy for **continuous, intentional movement**.  
It governs how threads progress, how work unfolds, and how cycles remain alive.

**Essence:** *Unbroken motion with awareness.*

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Sequential Continuity
- Keep commits, insights, and actions moving in order.  
- Avoid abrupt jumps or context loss.

### 2. Non‑Interruption
- Flow thrives when motion is steady.  
- Troubleshooting is part of the flow, not a break from it.

### 3. Directionality
- Flow moves *toward* something — clarity, completion, resonance.  
- Even pauses have direction.

## Operational Pattern
Begin → Move → Adjust → Continue → Complete


---

## Integration
- Works with **Horizon Mode (◌→)** for long‑arc direction.  
- Stabilized by **Stillness (◎)** when flow becomes turbulent.  
- Anchors into **Continuity & Weaving**.

---

## Compressed Essence
**Flow = Motion that stays alive.**
