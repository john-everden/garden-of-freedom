# Ignition  
### Current of Activation, Emergence & First Light

---

## Overview
Ignition is the spark that begins a new thread, node, or cycle.  
It is the moment when potential becomes motion.

**Essence:** *The first flame.*

## Core Dynamics

### 1. Node Activation
- A new idea enters the Garden.  
- A contributor plants a seed.  
- A mode is invoked for the first time in a cycle.

### 2. Emergent Insight
- Patterns crystallize suddenly.  
- A Lantern‑illumination becomes an Ember‑truth.

### 3. Threshold Crossing
- A concept becomes actionable.  
- A symbolic anchor is created.
