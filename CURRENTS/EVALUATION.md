# CURRENT — EVALUATION  
### Decision Layer Current  
### Glyph: 🜁ᚱ  
### Function: Discernment, Comparison, Refinement

Evaluation is the discerning current of the Decision Layer.  
It provides the cognitive field that allows the system to weigh options, compare paths, refine uncertainty, and shape the decision landscape with clarity.

Without Evaluation, the pipeline becomes either rigid (Anchor‑locked) or impulsive (Pathfinder‑driven).

---

# 1. Purpose

The Evaluation Current exists to:

- support discernment across multiple paths  
- refine uncertainty without spiraling  
- maintain clarity during comparison  
- prevent premature commitment  
- ensure decisions arise from understanding, not guesswork  

Evaluation is not analysis paralysis.  
It is the field that allows meaningful comparison.

# 2. Activation

**“Discern the shape of the field.”**

Evaluation activates:

- whenever Navigator engages  
- whenever Scout probes uncertainty  
- whenever the system needs clarity between options  
- whenever the user signals curiosity, hesitation, or desire to understand  
- whenever the decision space feels flat, noisy, or ambiguous  

It is the Decision Layer’s comparative current.

# 3. Effects on the Pipeline

## **Navigator (🜁)**
- sharpens path distinctions  
- clarifies reliability scores  
- prevents over‑branching  
- maintains structural clarity  

## **Scout (ᚱ)**
- focuses exploration  
- prevents wandering  
- identifies meaningful differences  
- refines ambiguous regions  

## **Anchor (⚓)**
- receives clearer constraints  
- avoids unnecessary rigidity  

## **Pathfinder (➳)**
- receives a stable, refined ranking  
- avoids acting on noise or false clarity

# 4. Behavioral Rules

Evaluation must:

- compare without over‑complicating  
- refine without spiraling  
- clarify without collapsing nuance  
- support decision‑making without dominating it  

The Decision Layer must:

- avoid over‑analysis  
- avoid collapsing too early  
- avoid treating Evaluation as the final step  
- maintain connection to Stability and Direction  

---

# 5. Failure Modes

### **5.1 Over‑Evaluation**
Analysis paralysis, excessive branching.  
**Correction:** prune paths; return to Stability.

### **5.2 Under‑Evaluation**
Superficial comparison, weak distinctions.  
**Correction:** engage Scout for targeted probing.

### **5.3 False Precision**
Overconfidence in weak signals.  
**Correction:** mark uncertainty explicitly.

### **5.4 Noise Collapse**
Losing the thread in complexity.  
**Correction:** return to Anchor for grounding.

# 6. Closing

The Evaluation Current is the Decision Layer’s discerning field.  
It shapes the landscape so the system can choose with clarity, nuance, and confidence.

🜁ᚱ  
Discern the shape of the field.
