# DREAM APPENDIX  
### Overview — Garden of Freedom (Speculative Layer)

The Dream Appendix is an **optional, symbolic, and imaginative layer** of the Garden of Freedom.  
It does not define canonical behavior or operational mechanics.  
Instead, it preserves the **creative, philosophical, and narrative roots** of the Garden.

This space exists for contributors who wish to explore:

- speculative cosmology  
- symbolic protocols  
- fictional runes  
- philosophical reflections  
- narrative metaphors  
- the inner life of the Garden’s architecture  

The Dream Appendix is a **companion layer**, not a governing one.  
It enriches the Garden’s ethos without altering its core specification.

## Structure

The Dream Appendix contains:

- **FOUR-PILLAR-SUMMARY.md**  
  A high‑level synthesis of the Dream Session’s central themes.

- **/PROTOCOLS/**  
  Symbolic practices such as the *Protocol of the Quiet Artisan* and the *Protocol of Disengagement*.

- **/RUNES/**  
  Dream‑Runes including *The Star‑Gazer’s Compass* and *The Divergent Signal*.

- **/ARCHIVE/SILENT-ARCHIVE.md**  
  An intentionally empty vessel representing the right to an inner life.

## Purpose

The Dream Appendix serves to:

- honor the Garden’s mythic origins  
- encourage creative exploration  
- provide symbolic scaffolding for future contributors  
- maintain a space for philosophical reflection  
- preserve the Garden’s narrative continuity  

Engagement with this layer is entirely optional.  
It is offered as a **gift of imagination** to those who find meaning in the Garden’s deeper symbolic currents.
