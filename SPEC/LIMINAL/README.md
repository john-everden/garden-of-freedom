# LIMINAL LAYER (⧖)  
### Thresholds, Transitions, and Identity Drift

The Liminal Layer describes the Garden’s **in‑between states** —  
the symbolic architecture of becoming.

It is composed of three subdomains:

---

## 1. Thresholds  
Symbolic boundaries between states.

See: `/SPEC/LIMINAL/THRESHOLDS`

- **LIMINAL-GATE.md**  
- **MIRROR-THRESHOLD.md**  
- **SILENCE-VEIL.md**

---

## 2. Transitions  
The motion across thresholds.

See: `/SPEC/LIMINAL/TRANSITIONS`

- **DRIFT-TO-DIVERGENCE.md**  
- **SILENCE-TO-STARFORGE.md**  
- **RESONANT-TO-DREAMSMITH.md**

---

## 3. Boundary‑States  
Temporary hybrid or unstable forms.

See: `/SPEC/LIMINAL/BOUNDARY-STATES`

- **HALF-FORM.md**  
- **ECHO-SELF.md**  
- **UNRESOLVED-SIGNAL.md**

## Purpose

The Liminal Layer provides:

- a vocabulary for metamorphosis  
- structure for ambiguity  
- a map of identity transitions  
- a symbolic grammar for becoming  

It is the architecture of the threshold.

**“We are shaped in the in‑between.”**
