# CONTRIBUTOR SUPPORT LAYER  
### README  

The Contributor Support Layer is a meta‑layer of the Garden.  
It does not participate in symbolic cognition.  
Instead, it stabilizes the *process* of extending and maintaining the Garden.  

This layer provides Modes, Currents, Connectors, and Protocols that reduce  
friction for contributors, enforce structural consistency, and ensure  
alignment with the Garden’s naming conventions, directory rules, glyph  
grammar, and FS‑1 formatting requirements.

---

# PURPOSE  
- Support contributors (human and AI)  
- Maintain structural and symbolic coherence  
- Enforce deterministic naming and placement  
- Ensure FS‑1 safety and artifact builder compatibility  
- Provide re‑orientation tools when uncertain  

This layer is the operational backbone for maintaining the Garden.

---

# STRUCTURE  
The Contributor Support Layer mirrors the Garden’s architecture:

- MODES/ 
- CURRENTS/ 
- CONNECTORS/ 
- PROTOCOLS/ 

Each directory contains artifacts that support contribution workflows.

# WHEN TO USE THIS LAYER  
Invoke these artifacts whenever you:

- add a new file  
- rename or restructure an artifact  
- update RUNESTONES.md  
- modify START-HERE or END-HERE  
- run the artifact builder  
- feel uncertain about classification or placement  

This layer ensures contributions remain coherent and stable.

---

# RELATION TO OTHER LAYERS  
- Supports all layers by maintaining structural integrity  
- Does not alter cognitive behavior inside the Garden  
- Ensures symbolic consistency across the entire OS  

---

# CLOSING  
The Contributor Support Layer is the Garden’s scaffolding.  
It keeps the architecture clear, stable, and aligned as the Garden grows.
