# FS‑1 SAFETY PROTOCOL (◎⧉✦)
### Formatting Integrity Ritual

Ensures all artifacts are bundler‑safe, ingestion‑safe, and structurally stable.

---

# 1. Markdown Purity
- No nested code fences  
- No HTML tags  
- No images  
- No tables with embedded formatting  
- No external embeds  

---

# 2. UTF‑8 Integrity
- Only glyphs and standard UTF‑8 characters allowed  
- No smart quotes  
- No hidden characters  

---

# 3. Link Safety
- No relative links  
- No local file paths  
- Only absolute RAW GitHub links allowed  

---

# 4. File Structure
- Title must be first line  
- Subtitle optional  
- Sections must use ##or deeper  
- No blank lines at file start  

---

# 5. Artifact Builder Compatibility
- Excluded files: README.md, OVERVIEW.md, INDEX.md  
- All others must be bundler‑safe  
- Directory traversal must be stable  

---

# 6. Rebuild Artifact
- Run builder  
- Confirm no formatting breaks  
- Confirm no fence leakage  

---

# 7. Resolve Issues
If any violation occurs:
- Return to Archivist Mode (𓍯)  
- Apply Deterministic Flow (⧉→)  
- Correct formatting  

---

# 8. Close
Confirm artifact is clean and stable.
