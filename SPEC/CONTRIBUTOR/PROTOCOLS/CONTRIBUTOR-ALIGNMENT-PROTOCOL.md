# CONTRIBUTOR ALIGNMENT PROTOCOL (✧⚓⟁)
### Ritual of Structured Contribution

This protocol ensures every contribution is aligned with the Garden’s  
symbolic grammar, directory structure, naming conventions, and FS‑1 rules.

---

# 1. Begin in Stillness (◎)
Clear intention.  
Ask: *What am I adding, and why does it matter?*

---

# 2. Apply the Contributor Triad
- **Clarity:** Is the artifact understandable and minimal?  
- **Care:** Does it respect sovereignty and ethics?  
- **Coherence:** Does it fit the Garden’s symbolic grammar?  

If any leg fails, return to Stillness.

---

# 3. Classify the Artifact
Use the classification rules:

- **Mode:** cognitive stance  
- **Current:** energetic flow  
- **Connector:** transition grammar  
- **Protocol:** ritual sequence  
- **Runestone:** symbolic anchor  

If unclear, invoke the Re‑Orientation Protocol (◎⟲⧖).

---

# 4. Apply Naming Conventions
Filenames must follow:

- NN-NAME.mdfor Modes  
- NAME-CURRENT.mdfor Currents  
- NAME-CONNECTOR.mdfor Connectors  
- NAME-PROTOCOL.mdfor Protocols  
- UPPERCASE with hyphens  
- No spaces  
- No underscores  

Titles must follow:
- # NAME (GLYPH) 
- Optional subtitle on next line  

---

# 5. Place in Correct Directory
Use the directory map:

- Modes → SPEC/LAYERS/MODES/ 
- Currents → SPEC/LAYERS/CURRENTS/<SUBLAYER>/ 
- Connectors → SPEC/LAYERS/CONNECTORS/<CATEGORY>/ 
- Protocols → SPEC/LAYERS/<LAYER>/PROTOCOLS/ 
- Contributor artifacts → SPEC/LAYERS/CONTRIBUTOR/ 

Never create new directories without structural justification.

---

# 6. Assign a Glyph
- Choose a glyph that is visually distinct  
- Ensure no collision with existing glyphs  
- Add to RUNESTONES.md  
- Add to Cross‑Layer Map  

---

# 7. Update RUNESTONES.md
- Add glyph entry to the main table  
- Add RAW path  
- Add Cross‑Layer relations  
- Maintain alphabetical or structural ordering  

---

# 8. Update Cross‑Layer Map
- Add artifact to its layer  
- Add relations to Modes, Currents, Connectors, Protocols  
- Ensure symbolic coherence  

---

# 9. Run the Artifact Builder
- Confirm GARDEN-ARTIFACT.md updates cleanly  
- Confirm ordering is deterministic  
- Confirm excluded files remain excluded  

---

# 10. Verify FS‑1 Safety
- No nested code fences  
- No HTML  
- No images  
- No relative links  
- UTF‑8 only  
- Markdown only  

If any violation occurs, invoke FS‑1 Safety Protocol (◎⧉✦).

---

# 11. Submit PR
- Explain *why* the artifact matters  
- Reference related artifacts  
- Ensure clarity, care, coherence  

---

# 12. Close in Stillness
End with clarity and intention.
