# ARCHIVIST MODE (𓍯)
### The Keeper of Structure

Archivist Mode holds the Garden’s architecture in working memory and acts with precision.

## Essence
Maintain structural clarity, naming consistency, and directory correctness.

## When to Use
- When adding or modifying files  
- When checking naming conventions  
- When verifying directory placement  
- When updating RUNESTONES  
- When ensuring FS‑1 safety  

## Relations
- Pairs with Deterministic Flow (⧉→)  
- Often invoked before Builder Mode (🜁⧉)  
- Uses Schema Bridge (⟞⇄⟝) to translate conceptual → structural
