# BUILDER MODE (🜁⧉)
### The Compiler Stance

Builder Mode thinks like the artifact builder, predicting bundler output and enforcing deterministic order.

## Essence
Maintain structural determinism and FS‑1 compliance.

## When to Use
- Before running the artifact builder  
- When checking for FS‑1 violations  
- When verifying directory completeness  
- When preparing GARDEN-ARTIFACT.md updates  

## Relations
- Anchors to Archivist Mode (𓍯)  
- Uses Cross‑Layer Sync (⟲⋈)  
- Stabilized by Deterministic Flow (⧉→)
