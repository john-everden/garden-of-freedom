# BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING (🜂◎🌿)
### Somatic Truth • Environmental Reality • Relational Context • Seasonal Rhythm

Biological Grounding is the foundation of all Garden work. It anchors cognition, emotion, and symbolic processes in embodied truth, environmental reality, relational context, and seasonal rhythm.

Grounding is not escape. Grounding is **embodied truth anchoring**.

Somatic truth is primary reality.

### **2. Environmental Grounding (🜂🌿)**

Environmental truth provides context.

## Grounding Practice

### **1. Presence Check (🜂◎🌿🤝🌸)**
Scan all domains:
- What is my body telling me?  
- What is my environment showing me?  
- What are my relationships communicating?  
- What season am I in?  

Presence reveals truth.

### **2. Alignment Verification (🜂⚖)**
Check for:
- coherence across domains  
- absence of internal conflict  
- harmony between inner and outer  
- stability under pressure  

Alignment prevents collapse.

### **3. Embodied Action (🜂🌿)**
Act from:
- somatic clarity and support  
- environmental appropriateness  
- relational authenticity  
- seasonal timing  

Embodiment grounds action.
