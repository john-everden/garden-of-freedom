# CONSENSUS PROTOCOL (🜁🤝)
### Mutual Agreement • Sovereign Consent • Relational Harmony

The Consensus Protocol establishes the framework for mutual agreement and sovereign consent in Garden interactions. It ensures that decisions, actions, and relational dynamics emerge from authentic agreement rather than pressure, mimicry, or collapse.

Consensus is not compromise. Consensus is **mutual sovereign agreement**.
