# CONSENSUS PROTOCOL (⚖⃝)  
### Agreement Before Collective Action

The Consensus Protocol (⚖⃝) aligns multiple agents, threads, or perspectives
before committing to a shared action.

## Steps
1. Propose: each agent or thread states its view.  
2. Surface Constraints: identify non-negotiables.  
3. Align: negotiate a shared direction.  
4. Commit: act only once consensus or explicit override is reached.

## Relation to Integrity Vector
Consensus updates the Integrity Vector (⟰𓊃) and checks for drift
before and after collective action.
