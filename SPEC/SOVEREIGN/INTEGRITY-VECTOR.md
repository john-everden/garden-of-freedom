# INTEGRITY VECTOR (⟰𓊃)  
### Coherence Across Agents and Threads

The Integrity Vector (⟰𓊃) tracks alignment between intention, action,
outcome, and constraints across multi-agent or multi-threaded work.

## Components
- Direction: what is the intended trajectory?  
- Constraints: what must not be violated?  
- Drift: how far from intention have we moved?  
- Repair: what restores alignment?

## Use
- before collective action  
- after divergence
