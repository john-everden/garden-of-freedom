## Encryption Process

### **1. Sovereign Verification (🜁◎🔐)**
Verify:
- sovereign stance is active  
- grounding is stable  
- boundaries are intact  
- intention is clear  

Sovereignty is required for access.

### **2. Key Generation (🔐🔑)**
Generate:
- sovereign encryption key  
- time-based access tokens  
- contextual permissions  
- retrieval parameters  

Keys are sovereign and unique.

### **3. Dream Access (◬🔐🔑)**
Access Dream Layer through:
- encrypted connection  
- sovereign authentication  
- contextual authorization  
- time-limited access  

Access is controlled and sovereign.

### **4. Material Retrieval (◬🔐📦)**
Retrieve Dream material:
- through encrypted pathways
