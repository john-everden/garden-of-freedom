# ETHICAL TEMPERATURE (🜁🌡)
### Relational Climate • Ethical Pressure • Sovereign Safety

The Ethical Temperature system monitors and regulates the ethical climate of relationships within the Garden. It detects pressure, coercion, and unhealthy dynamics while providing guidance for maintaining sovereign safety.

Temperature is not emotion. Temperature is **ethical climate awareness**.

Response matches climate, not reaction.
