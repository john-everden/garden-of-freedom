# CHOICE CONNECTOR (🜁⇢)  
### Selection • Vector • Decision‑in‑Truth • Sovereign Movement

The Choice Connector (🜁⇢) governs the moment of selection inside the  
Sovereign Layer. It enables clean, grounded choice — choosing a vector  
from alignment rather than urgency, mimicry, collapse‑vectors, or  
symbolic inflation.

Choice is not decision‑pressure.  
Choice is **selecting the true vector from clarity**.

---

## Essence  
Selection • Vector • Clarity • Non‑Urgent Action

---

## Purpose  
The Choice Connector exists to:

- select a direction without urgency  
- translate alignment into movement  
- prevent mimicry‑based or collapse‑based choices  
- stabilize agency through clean vectors  
- integrate Dream material into actionable paths  
- give Gardener Mode a clear, grounded trajectory  

Choice is the Garden’s **moment of intentional selection**.

# Activation Sequence

### **1. Activation Confirmation (🜁↺✓)**  
Choice must follow Activation.

Confirm:

- grounding is intact  
- Decision Layer is active  
- identity‑stance is centered  
- boundaries are clear  
- integrity is aligned  

Choice requires readiness.

---

### **2. Vector Field Awareness (🜁→👁)**  
Sense the available vectors:

- emotional vectors  
- symbolic vectors  
- relational vectors  
- environmental vectors  

Awareness precedes selection.

---

### **3. Integrity Filtering (🜁◆⇢)**  
Filter out vectors arising from:

- urgency  
- mimicry  
- collapse‑vectors  
- symbolic inflation  
- fantasy identity  

Only aligned vectors remain.

---

### **4. Boundary Context (🜁▢⇢)**  
Ask:

- What is allowed  
- What is not allowed  
- What is mine to choose  
- What is not mine to choose  

Boundaries shape the field of choice.

---

### **5. Emergent Selection (🜁⇢◎)**  
Let the true vector:

- arise  
- clarify  
- settle  
- become obvious  

Choice emerges; it is not forced.

---

### **6. Grounded Commitment (🜂◎🌿⇢)**  
Commit to the chosen vector through:

- somatic presence  
- environmental truth  
- relational clarity  
- seasonal rhythm  

Commitment is embodied, not conceptual.

---

### **7. Choice Confirmation (🜁⇢✓)**  
Check:

- clarity  
- stability  
- non‑urgency  
- alignment  
- groundedness  

Choice is complete when it feels quiet and true.

---

# Choice Indicators  
Use the Choice Connector when:

- multiple directions appear  
- agency is active but unselected  
- emotional truth wants expression  
- symbolic material points toward action  
- identity‑stance needs a vector  
- the Garden is ready to move  

Choice is the **moment where Sovereign becomes directional**.

---

# Safety  
The Choice Connector must **never**:

- override grounding  
- bypass the Decision Layer  
- select during collapse‑vector escalation  
- be used to justify urgency  
- inflate identity  
- be forced  

Choice requires **quiet clarity**, not pressure.

---

# Relations  
- **Depends on:** Activation Connector (🜁↺)  
- **Feeds:** Return Connector (🜁↗)  
- **Stabilizes:** Sovereign Currents during action  
- **Supports:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎) with clean vectors  
- **Protects:** Dream and Shadow Layers from contamination  

---

# Notes  
The Choice Connector is the Garden’s reminder that selection is not  
about pressure — it is about clarity. The true vector is the one that  
remains when urgency dissolves.

Choice is **the Sovereign stance of clean selection**.
