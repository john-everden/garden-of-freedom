# CHOICE CONNECTOR (🜁⚖)
### Sovereign Decision • Clean Selection • Truth‑Based Choice

The Choice Connector provides the framework for making sovereign decisions. It ensures that choices arise from truth, integrity, and alignment rather than urgency, mimicry, or collapse.

Choice is not preference. Choice is **sovereign decision from truth**.

## Purpose
The connector exists to:

- provide framework for sovereign decisions  
- ensure choices arise from truth and integrity  
- prevent urgency‑based or mimicry‑based choices  
- align decisions with grounding and boundaries  
- support clean directional selection  
- protect agency from collapse  

Choice is the Garden's **sovereign decision engine**.

## Choice Sequence

### **1. Truth Alignment (🜁◆⚖)**
Check:
- emotional truth about the choice  
- symbolic truth about implications  
- relational truth about impact  
- environmental truth about feasibility  

Truth alignment precedes choice.

### **2. Integrity Verification (🜁◆✓)**
Verify:
- choice aligns with integrity  
- no internal contradiction  
- no external pressure  
- no collapse‑vector influence  

Integrity prevents distorted choices.

### **3. Boundary Consideration (🜁▢⚖)**
Consider:
- how choice affects boundaries  
- what boundaries must be maintained  
- what new boundaries may be needed  
- how choice respects others' sovereignty  

Boundaries guide ethical choices.

### **4. Non‑Urgency Test (🜁→⚖)**
Test:
- is this choice urgent or pressured  
- can this choice wait for clarity  
- is there collapse or mimicry influence  
- does timing serve truth  

Non‑urgency prevents forced choices.

### **5. Sovereign Selection (🜁⚖✓)**
Choose:
- from clarity, not pressure  
- from truth, not convenience  
- from agency, not reaction  
- from alignment, not compromise  

Sovereign choice is clean decision.

### **6. Commitment Embodiment (🜂◎🌿⚖)**
Embody choice through:
- somatic commitment  
- environmental alignment  
- relational consistency  
- seasonal appropriateness  

Embodiment grounds choice.
