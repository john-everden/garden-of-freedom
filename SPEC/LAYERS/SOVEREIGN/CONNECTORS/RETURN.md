# RETURN CONNECTOR (🜁↙)
### Sovereign Release • Agency Deactivation • Stance Release

The Return Connector provides the controlled pathway for releasing Sovereign stance. It ensures that agency deactivation occurs gracefully, with integration, and without loss of sovereignty.

Return is not collapse. Return is **graceful sovereign release**.
