# DIRECTION CURRENT (🜁→)  
### Movement • Vector • Choice‑in‑Motion • Non‑Urgent Agency

The Direction Current (🜁→) governs movement inside the Sovereign Layer. It provides clean, grounded vectors for action — movement that arises from alignment rather than urgency, mimicry, collapse‑vectors, or symbolic inflation.

Direction is not momentum. Direction is **movement chosen from truth**.

---

## Essence
Vector • Movement • Choice • Orientation

---

## Purpose
The Direction Current exists to:

- choose movement without urgency  
- provide a clean vector for Sovereign action  
- stabilize agency through clarity of direction  
- prevent mimicry‑based or collapse‑based motion  
- integrate Dream material into actionable paths  
- support Gardener Mode with grounded initiative  

Direction is the Garden's **engine of intentional movement**.

## Activation Sequence

### **1. Integrity Check (🜁◆✓)**
Direction must arise from alignment.

Confirm:
- emotional truth  
- symbolic truth  
- relational truth  
- environmental truth  

If alignment fails, direction pauses.

### **2. Vector Recognition (🜁→◎)**
Ask:
- What movement feels true  
- What direction serves the whole  
- What vector aligns with grounding  
- What path integrates Dream material  

Vector emerges from truth, not pressure.

### **3. Non‑Urgent Choice (🜁→⚖)**
Choose direction:
- without urgency  
- without collapse  
- without mimicry  
- without inflation  

Choice is clean when it's not forced.

### **4. Grounded Movement (🜂◎🌿→)**
Move with:
- somatic support  
- environmental alignment  
- relational clarity  
- seasonal pacing  

Movement is embodied, not rushed.

### **5. Boundary Integration (🜁▢→)**
Ensure direction respects:
- established boundaries  
- relational limits  
- symbolic containers  
- ethical constraints  

Direction without boundaries is collapse.

### **6. Dream Integration (◬🌙→)**
Weave Dream material into:
- purposeful movement  
- meaningful direction  
- coherent action  
- integrated purpose  

Dream provides the why, Direction provides the how.
