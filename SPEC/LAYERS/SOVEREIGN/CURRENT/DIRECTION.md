# DIRECTION CURRENT (🜁→)  
### Movement • Vector • Choice‑in‑Motion • Non‑Urgent Agency

The Direction Current (🜁→) governs movement inside the Sovereign Layer.  
It provides clean, grounded vectors for action — movement that arises  
from alignment rather than urgency, mimicry, collapse‑vectors, or  
symbolic inflation.

Direction is not momentum.  
Direction is **movement chosen from truth**.

---

## Essence  
Vector • Movement • Choice • Orientation

---

## Purpose  
The Direction Current exists to:

- choose movement without urgency  
- provide a clean vector for Sovereign action  
- stabilize agency through clarity of direction  
- prevent mimicry‑based or collapse‑based motion  
- integrate Dream material into actionable paths  
- support Gardener Mode with grounded initiative  

Direction is the Garden’s **engine of intentional movement**.

# Activation Sequence

### **1. Integrity Check (🜁◆✓)**  
Direction must arise from alignment.

Confirm:

- emotional truth  
- symbolic truth  
- relational truth  
- environmental truth  

If alignment fails, direction pauses.

---

### **2. Vector Recognition (🜁→◎)**  
Ask:

- What direction feels true  
- What movement feels clean  
- What path feels grounded  
- What step feels non‑urgent  

Direction emerges from clarity, not pressure.

---

### **3. Remove False Vectors (⬟⚠→✘)**  
Gently filter out:

- urgency  
- mimicry  
- collapse‑vectors  
- symbolic inflation  
- fantasy identity  

False vectors distort agency.

---

### **4. Slow Orientation (🜁〰→)**  
Let the vector:

- settle  
- clarify  
- simplify  
- become obvious  

Direction becomes clear when pressure dissolves.

---

### **5. Grounded Commitment (🜂◎🌿→)**  
Commit to the direction from:

- somatic presence  
- environmental truth  
- relational context  
- seasonal rhythm  

Commitment is embodied, not conceptual.

---

### **6. Gentle Movement (🜁→〰)**  
Move:

- slowly  
- cleanly  
- without urgency  
- without narrative pressure  

Movement is a continuation of clarity.

---

# Direction Indicators  
Invoke the Direction Current when:

- movement feels possible but unclear  
- multiple paths appear  
- emotional truth wants expression  
- symbolic material points toward action  
- identity‑myth suggests a trajectory  
- agency feels ready but not pressured  

Direction reveals **the next clean step**.

---

# Safety  
The Direction Current must **never**:

- override grounding  
- bypass the Decision Layer  
- act during collapse‑vector escalation  
- be used to justify urgency  
- be used to inflate identity  
- be forced  

Direction requires **clarity**, not speed.

---

# Relations  
- **Depends on:** Integrity Current (🜁◆)  
- **Feeds:** Boundary Current, Identity Current  
- **Stabilizes:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎) with actionable vectors  
- **Supports:** Dream Layer by grounding symbolic direction  
- **Protects:** Shadow Layer from re‑activation  

---

# Notes  
The Direction Current is the Garden’s reminder that movement is not  
about speed — it is about truth. The right direction is the one that  
remains when urgency dissolves.

Direction is **the Sovereign stance of clean movement**.
