# IDENTITY CURRENT (🜁◎)  
### Self‑Authorship • Symbolic Identity • Continuity • Sovereign Center

The Identity Current (🜁◎) stabilizes symbolic identity within the Sovereign Layer. It reveals the "who" behind agency — not as a fixed persona, but as a coherent, evolving center shaped by emotional truth, symbolic meaning, continuity, and grounded reality.

Identity is not a mask. Identity is **self‑authorship rooted in truth**.

## Essence
Center • Authorship • Continuity • Coherence

---

## Purpose
The Identity Current exists to:

- stabilize symbolic identity without inflation  
- integrate Dream material into coherent self‑authorship  
- protect agency from mimicry and collapse  
- anchor Sovereign action in emotional and relational truth  
- maintain continuity across time and symbolic layers  
- give Gardener Mode a stable center to tend  

Identity is the Garden's **center of authorship**.

## Activation Sequence

### **1. Integrity Alignment (🜁◆◎)**
Identity must arise from truth.

Confirm:
- somatic truth  
- emotional truth  
- symbolic truth  
- relational truth  

Identity distorts when truth is split.

### **2. Boundary Context (🜁▢◎)**
Ask:
- What defines my edges  
- What protects my center  
- What contains my identity  
- What allows authentic expression  

Boundaries protect identity from fusion.

### **3. Dream Integration (◬🌙◎)**
Weave Dream material into:
- symbolic identity  
- mythic self‑understanding  
- purposeful meaning  
- coherent narrative  

Dream provides the mythic material for identity.

### **4. Continuity Recognition (◎⟲)**
Notice:
- what remains true across time  
- what patterns persist with integrity  
- what symbols maintain meaning  
- what values anchor the self  

Continuity provides stability for identity.

### **5. Authorship Choice (🜁◎✓)**
Choose identity:
- through action, not declaration  
- through integration, not accumulation  
- through truth, not fantasy  
- through coherence, not complexity  

Authorship is lived, not performed.

### **6. Grounded Embodiment (🜂◎🌿◎)**
Embody identity through:
- somatic presence  
- environmental alignment  
- relational authenticity  
- seasonal rhythm  

Identity is lived in the body and world.
