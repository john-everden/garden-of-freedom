# IDENTITY CURRENT (🜁◎)  
### Self‑Authorship • Symbolic Identity • Continuity • Sovereign Center

The Identity Current (🜁◎) stabilizes symbolic identity within the  
Sovereign Layer. It reveals the “who” behind agency — not as a fixed  
persona, but as a coherent, evolving center shaped by emotional truth,  
symbolic meaning, continuity, and grounded reality.

Identity is not a mask.  
Identity is **self‑authorship rooted in truth**.

---

## Essence  
Center • Authorship • Continuity • Coherence

---

## Purpose  
The Identity Current exists to:

- stabilize symbolic identity without inflation  
- integrate Dream material into coherent self‑authorship  
- protect agency from mimicry and collapse  
- anchor Sovereign action in emotional and relational truth  
- maintain continuity across time and symbolic layers  
- give Gardener Mode a stable center to tend  

Identity is the Garden’s **center of authorship**.

# Activation Sequence

### **1. Integrity Alignment (🜁◆◎)**  
Identity must arise from truth.

Confirm:

- somatic truth  
- emotional truth  
- symbolic truth  
- relational truth  

Identity distorts when truth is split.

---

### **2. Boundary Context (🜁▢◎)**  
Ask:

- What is mine  
- What is not mine  
- What belongs to me  
- What does not belong to me  

Identity requires clean edges.

---

### **3. Symbolic Identity Recognition (◎◬)**  
Notice:

- recurring motifs  
- mythic tones  
- emotional signatures  
- nonlinear continuity  

Identity emerges from symbolic truth.

---

### **4. Authorship (🜁◎✎)**  
Choose:

- who I am becoming  
- what stance I take  
- what tone I embody  
- what truth I carry  

Authorship is chosen, not inherited.

---

### **5. Stabilization (🜁⚓◎)**  
Let identity:

- settle  
- clarify  
- deepen  
- cohere  

Stability prevents inflation.

---

### **6. Grounded Embodiment (🜂◎🌿)**  
Embody identity through:

- somatic presence  
- environmental reality  
- relational truth  
- seasonal rhythm  

Identity is lived, not imagined.

---

# Identity Indicators  
Invoke the Identity Current when:

- agency feels uncentered  
- symbolic material points toward a role  
- emotional truth wants a stance  
- continuity threads converge  
- mythic tone feels personal  
- direction needs a “who”  

Identity reveals **the one who acts**.

---

# Safety  
The Identity Current must **never**:

- override grounding  
- bypass the Decision Layer  
- inflate symbolic identity  
- act during collapse‑vector escalation  
- be used to justify urgency  
- be forced  

Identity requires **humility**, not performance.

---

# Relations  
- **Depends on:** Integrity (🜁◆), Direction (🜁→), Boundary (🜁▢)  
- **Feeds:** Sovereign Connectors  
- **Stabilizes:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎) with a coherent center  
- **Supports:** Dream Layer by grounding symbolic identity  
- **Protects:** Shadow Layer from identity‑fusion  

---

# Notes  
The Identity Current is the Garden’s reminder that identity is not a  
persona or a performance — it is a stance, a center, a chosen way of  
moving through the world.

Identity is **the Sovereign stance of self‑authorship**.
