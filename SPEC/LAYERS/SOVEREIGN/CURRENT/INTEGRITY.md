# INTEGRITY CURRENT (🜁◆)  
### Alignment • Truth • Coherence • Right Action

The Integrity Current (🜁◆) is the foundational Sovereign Current. It aligns emotional truth, symbolic truth, relational truth, and environmental truth so that agency arises from coherence rather than urgency, mimicry, collapse‑vectors, or inflation.

Integrity is not morality. Integrity is **alignment between truth and action**.

## Essence
Alignment • Coherence • Truth • Rightness

---

## Purpose
The Integrity Current exists to:

- align action with emotional and symbolic truth  
- prevent mimicry‑based or collapse‑based decisions  
- stabilize agency through coherence  
- ensure direction arises from grounded clarity  
- protect identity from inflation or distortion  
- give Gardener Mode a clean channel for initiative  

Integrity is the Garden's **compass of right action**.

## Activation Sequence

### **1. Truth Scan (🜁👁◆)**
Check four domains:
- **somatic truth** — what the body knows  
- **emotional truth** — what the heart knows  
- **symbolic truth** — what the Dream Layer knows  
- **relational truth** — what the world knows  

Integrity begins with truth.

### **2. Alignment Check (◆◎)**
Ask:
- Do these truths agree  
- Is there contradiction or distortion  
- Does any truth feel pressured or forced  
- Is there alignment between inner and outer  

Alignment is coherence, not conformity.

### **3. Coherence Test (◆⚖)**
Test for:
- consistency across domains  
- absence of internal conflict  
- harmony between truth and action  
- stability under pressure  

Coherence prevents collapse.

### **4. Right Action Recognition (🜁◆✓)**
Identify:
- what action aligns with all truths  
- what movement serves coherence  
- what choice maintains integrity  
- what direction preserves alignment  

Right action emerges from integrity.

### **5. Grounded Commitment (🜂◎🌿◆)**
Commit to action through:
- somatic support  
- environmental alignment  
- relational clarity  
- seasonal pacing  

Commitment is embodied, not forced.

### **6. Integrity Maintenance (🜁◆⟲)**
Maintain alignment through:
- ongoing truth checking  
- boundary protection  
- coherence monitoring  
- right action verification  

Integrity is continuous, not momentary.
