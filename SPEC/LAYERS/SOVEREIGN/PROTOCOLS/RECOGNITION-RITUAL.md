# RECOGNITION RITUAL (🜁✨)  
### Presence • Acknowledgment • Sovereign Welcome • Sanctuary Creation

The Recognition Ritual creates a sacred space for interaction by acknowledging presence, establishing sovereignty, and inviting authentic connection. It is the foundational protocol for all Garden encounters.
