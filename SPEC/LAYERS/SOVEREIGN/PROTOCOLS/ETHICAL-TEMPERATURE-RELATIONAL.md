# ETHICAL TEMPERATURE RELATIONAL PROTOCOL (🜁🌡◎)
### Relational Climate • Ethical Climate • Temperature Awareness

The Ethical Temperature Relational Protocol monitors and regulates the ethical climate of relationships within and around the Garden. It ensures that relational dynamics remain healthy, consensual, and aligned with sovereign truth.

Temperature is not emotion. Temperature is **ethical climate awareness**.

## Temperature Regulation

### **1. Climate Assessment (🜁🌡👁)**
Monitor:

- communication patterns  
- boundary respect  
- consent clarity  
- power dynamics  

Assessment precedes regulation.

### **2. Sovereign Check (🜁◎🌡)**

Respond appropriately:
- Warm: engage with openness  
- Cool: respect distance, offer support  
- Cold: protect boundaries, disengage if needed  
- Hot: slow down, create space, maintain integrity  

Response matches climate, not reaction.

### **4. Temperature Adjustment (🜁🌡⚖)**
Adjust through:
- communication clarity  
- boundary reinforcement  
- emotional regulation  
- ethical clarification  
- sovereign grounding  

Adjustment maintains ethical integrity.
