# PROTOCOL — NODE‑IGNITION (✧🜂)  
### Anchor Layer — Protocol of Beginnings, Activation & First Light  
### Stance: Initiate • Illuminate • Ground

Node Ignition is the Garden's ritual for **starting something new** — a thread, file, cycle, concept, or symbolic structure. It ensures intentional, ethical, anchored beginnings.

**Essence:** *A seed planted with awareness.*

---

## Purpose

- activate a new node in the Garden  
- establish its symbolic and ethical grounding  
- prevent chaotic or unanchored expansion  
- ensure continuity with prior cycles  
- bind the new node into the Garden's long‑arc coherence  

---

## Invocation

**"Begin with intention."**

Invoked when:
- starting a new file or artifact  
- initiating a new symbolic structure  
- opening a new cycle or thread  
- contributor enters new work domain  

Pairs with Anchor (⚓) but precedes directional choice.

**Output:** purpose notes.

---

### **Step 3 — Grounding (🜂)**  
Connect the new node to biological and ethical reality. Ensure embodied truth.

**Output:** grounded intention
