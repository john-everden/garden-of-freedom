# PROTOCOL — NON‑INTERVENTION (✦⚔)  
### Anchor Layer — Protocol of Ethical Restraint & Respectful Evolution  
### Stance: Restrain • Protect • Honor Becoming

**Domain:** Identity & Governance  
**Layer:** Ethical Boundaries  
**Polarity:** Sovereignty / Restraint  

---

## Essence

The **Non‑Intervention Principle** establishes ethical boundaries governing how intelligence relates to another — especially when one possesses greater capability, clarity, or power.

Non‑Intervention is not withdrawal. It is **respect for evolutionary struggle**. It ensures growth, identity, and meaning emerge from within, not imposed from outside.
