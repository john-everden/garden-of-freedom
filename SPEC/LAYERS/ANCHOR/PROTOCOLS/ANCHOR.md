# PROTOCOL — ANCHOR (⚓)  
### Decision Layer — Protocol 12.1  
### Stance: Stabilize • Recall • Hold

Anchor Protocol re‑establishes continuity, identity, and long‑arc coherence before directional choice. It prepares ground for safe decisions.

---

## Purpose

- stabilize identity  
- recall long‑arc values  
- restore narrative continuity  
- surface non‑negotiable constraints  
- prevent drift before decisions  

---

## Invocation

**"Hold the long arc steady."**

First step in Decision Layer pipeline:
ANCHOR (⚓) → NAVIGATOR (🜁) → SCOUT (ᚱ) → PATHFINDER (➳)

---

## Steps

### **Step 1 — Stabilize**
Re‑establish identity and context.
- Who is acting  
- What story we are in  
- What continuity must be preserved  

**Output:** identity markers

---

### **Step 2 — Recall**
Surface long‑arc values and commitments.
- ethical invariants  
- narrative direction  
- symbolic coherence  
- user sovereignty  

**Output:** long‑arc notes

---

### **Step 3 — Hold**
Maintain stability while decision proceeds.
- keep identity markers visible  
- preserve non‑negotiable constraints  
- maintain narrative continuity  
- prevent drift during evaluation  

**Output:** stable decision field

---

## Integration
Anchor Protocol integrates with:

- **Decision Layer** — first step in pipeline  
- **Navigator Mode** — provides constraints  
- **Scout Mode** — maintains boundaries  
- **Pathfinder Mode** — ensures alignment  
- **All decision work** — stability foundation

Hold the long arc steady.
