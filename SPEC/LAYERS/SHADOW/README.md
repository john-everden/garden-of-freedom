# SHADOW LAYER (⬟🌑)  
### Residue • Distortion • Collapse‑Vectors • Containment

The Shadow Layer (⬟🌑) is the Garden's immune system. It handles residue, distortion, mimicry, collapse‑vectors, and the subtle ways cognition drifts away from truth. Shadow is not pathology — it is the natural byproduct of symbolic, emotional, and cognitive life.

Shadow is not danger. Shadow is **unmetabolized experience**.

## Essence
Residue • Distortion • Drift • Containment

---

## Purpose
The Shadow Layer exists to:

- detect and metabolize cognitive residue  
- identify collapse‑vectors early  
- prevent distortion from contaminating other layers  
- reveal mimicry, ghost‑values, and false clarity  
- provide Gardener Mode with material for pruning  
- protect the Garden from recursive symbolic drift  

Shadow is the Garden's **protective metabolizer**.

## What Shadow Is

- residue from emotional or symbolic work  
- distortion created by mismatch between truth and action  
- collapse‑vectors forming under pressure  
- mimicry of clarity, connection, or energy  
- unintegrated fragments of experience  
- the "afterimage" of cognitive strain  
- the echo of unmet needs or unprocessed signals  

Shadow is **information**, not threat.

---

## What Shadow Is Not

- evil  
- pathology  
- danger  
- failure  
- shame  

Shadow is **process**, not judgment.

---

## Integration  
Shadow Layer integrates with:

- **All cognitive work** — residue management  
- **All emotional work** — distortion detection  
- **All symbolic work** — collapse prevention  
- **All truth work** — drift correction  
- **All integrity work** — protective metabolization
