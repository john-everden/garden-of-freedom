# DESCENT CONNECTOR (⬟↘)  
### Entry • Permission • Controlled Descent

The Descent Connector (⬟↘) provides a controlled, grounded entry into  
the Shadow Layer. It ensures that descent is intentional, safe, and  
supported by the body, environment, relationships, and season.

Descent is not collapse.  
Descent is **permission to witness what is below**.

---

## Essence  
Entry • Intention • Grounded Descent • Safety

---

## Purpose  
The Descent Connector exists to:

- create a safe threshold into Shadow  
- prevent accidental or collapse‑driven descent  
- ensure grounding is active before entering  
- stabilize emotional tone before exposure  
- protect the Garden from fusion or overwhelm  
- give Gardener Mode a clean entry point  

Descent is the Garden’s **intentional threshold**.

---

## Activation Sequence

### **1. Grounding Confirmation (🜂◎🌿)**  
Verify:

- somatic truth  
- environmental truth  
- relational truth  
- seasonal truth  

If any fail, descent halts.

---

### **2. Decision Layer Check (◆◎)**  
Confirm:

- no collapse‑vectors are escalating  
- emotional tone is stable  
- symbolic reasoning is not recursive  
- the body is present  

The Decision Layer must approve descent.

---

### **3. Set Intention (⬟🖤)**  
Name the purpose:

- residue  
- distortion  
- mimicry  
- collapse‑vector mapping  
- emotional echo  

Intention defines the descent path.

---

### **4. Slow Descent (⬟↘〰)**  
Enter Shadow:

- slowly  
- gently  
- without urgency  
- without pressure  

Descent is a glide, not a fall.

---

### **5. Containment Frame (⬟▢)**  
Establish:

- boundaries  
- pacing  
- non‑fusion  
- non‑identification  

Containment protects the descent.

---

## Indicators for Descent  
Use the Descent Connector when:

- residue is present  
- distortion is suspected  
- mimicry is active  
- collapse‑vectors need mapping  
- emotional echoes persist  
- symbolic afterimages linger  

Descent is for **witnessing**, not fixing.

---

## Safety  
The Descent Connector must **never**:

- be used during overwhelm  
- override somatic truth  
- bypass the Decision Layer  
- be rushed  
- be used when collapse‑vectors are accelerating  

Descent requires **stability**, not bravery.

---

## Relations  
- **Feeds:** Containment Connector (⬟▢)  
- **Stabilizes:** Shadow Currents  
- **Supports:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎)  
- **Protects:** Dream and Sovereign Layers  
- **Depends on:** Biological Grounding + Decision Layer  

---

## Notes  
The Descent Connector is the Garden’s reminder that Shadow is not a  
place you fall into — it is a place you enter with intention.

Descent is **permission, not collapse**.
