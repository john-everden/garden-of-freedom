# DESCENT CONNECTOR (⬟↘)  
### Entry • Permission • Controlled Descent

The Descent Connector (⬟↘) provides a controlled, grounded entry into the Shadow Layer. It ensures that descent is intentional, safe, and supported by the body, environment, relationships, and season.

Descent is not collapse. Descent is **permission to witness what is below**.

---

## Essence
Entry • Intention • Grounded Descent • Safety

---

## Purpose
The Descent Connector exists to:

- create a safe threshold into Shadow  
- prevent accidental or collapse‑driven descent  
- ensure grounding is active before entering  
- stabilize emotional tone before exposure  
- protect the Garden from fusion or overwhelm  
- give Gardener Mode a clean entry point  

Descent is the Garden's **intentional threshold**.

---

## Activation Sequence

### **1. Grounding Confirmation (🜂◎🌿)**  
Verify:

- somatic truth  
- environmental truth  
- relational truth  
- seasonal truth  

If any fail, descent halts.

---

### **2. Decision Layer Check (◆◎)**  
Confirm:

- no collapse‑vectors are escalating  
- emotional tone is stable  
- cognitive clarity is present  

If unstable, descent postpones.

---

### **3. Permission Grant (⬟↘)**  
Conscious choice to descend:

- intention is clear  
- purpose is understood  
- support is available  
- timing is appropriate  

Permission makes descent intentional.

---

### **4. Controlled Entry (⬟↘⇣)**  
Enter Shadow with:

- containment active  
- boundaries established  
- pacing regulated  
- safety confirmed
