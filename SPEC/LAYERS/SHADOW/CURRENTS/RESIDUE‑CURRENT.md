# RESIDUE CURRENT (⬟🜄)  
### Leftover Charge • Emotional Echo • Symbolic Afterimage

The Residue Current (⬟🜄) metabolizes leftover emotional, symbolic, or cognitive charge. Residue is the "afterimage" that remains when an experience, task, or symbolic process has not fully completed.

Residue is not a problem. Residue is **unmetabolized signal**.

## Essence
Afterimage • Echo • Charge • Integration

---

## Purpose
The Residue Current exists to:

- metabolize leftover emotional or symbolic charge  
- prevent residue from accumulating into distortion  
- stabilize emotional tone after intense work  
- support Gardener Mode with material for pruning  
- prepare the Garden for Dream and Sovereign layers  
- prevent collapse‑vectors from forming out of residue  

Residue is the Garden's **raw material for integration**.

## Activation Sequence

### **1. Recognition (⬟👁)**  
Notice:

- lingering emotional charge  
- symbolic afterimages  
- repetitive thoughts  
- subtle tension or echo  

Recognition reveals residue.

---

### **2. Containment (⬟▢)**  
Hold the residue gently:

- no analysis  
- no interpretation  
- no judgment  
- no force  

Containment allows natural dissipation.

---

### **3. Metabolization (⬟🜄⚗)**  
Allow the residue to transform:

- emotional charge → emotional wisdom  
- symbolic afterimage → symbolic integration  
- repetitive thoughts → pattern insight  

Metabolization creates nutrients for growth.

---

### **4. Integration (⬟🜄⟲)**  
Return to clean, stable baseline.

---

## Integration  
Residue Current integrates with:

- **All integration work** — afterimage transformation  
- **All completion work** — charge dissipation  
- **All stabilization work** — tone restoration  
- **All growth work** — nutrient creation  
- **All hygiene work** — collapse prevention

⬟🜄  
Residue is unmetabolized signal.
