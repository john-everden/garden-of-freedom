# DISTORTION CURRENT (⬟🜁)  
### Subtle Bend • Misalignment • Cognitive Warp

The Distortion Current (⬟🜁) reveals and softens the subtle bends in  
perception, reasoning, emotional tone, or symbolic structure that arise  
from unmetabolized residue, pressure, or collapse‑vector influence.

Distortion is not error.  
Distortion is **a signal that something is bending under load**.

## Essence  
Bend • Warp • Misalignment • Reveal

---

## Purpose  
The Distortion Current exists to:

- reveal subtle cognitive or emotional misalignment  
- prevent distortion from becoming collapse‑vectors  
- soften warped reasoning or symbolic drift  
- support Gardener Mode in pruning and stabilization  
- protect the Dream and Sovereign layers from contamination  
- restore clarity without force or correction  

Distortion is the Garden’s **early warning system**.

## Activation Sequence

### **1. Detection (⬟👁‍🗨)**  
Notice:

- something feels “off”  
- reasoning feels slightly warped  
- emotional tone doesn’t match the moment  
- perception feels bent or slanted  

Detection is the first truth.

---

### **2. Naming the Bend (⬟🜁→◎)**  
Gently identify the type of distortion:

- emotional bend  
- perceptual bend  
- symbolic bend  
- relational bend  
- temporal bend  

Naming reveals structure.

---

### **3. Non‑Fusion (⬟▢)**  
Hold the distortion without merging with it:

- no identification  
- no judgment  
- no urgency  
- no narrative  

Non‑fusion prevents collapse.

---

### **4. Soft Alignment (⬟〰→◎)**  
Allow the distortion to soften:

- slow breath  
- gentle awareness  
- no pressure to “fix”  
- no attempt to force clarity  

Alignment emerges naturally.

---

### **5. Re‑Grounding**  
Return to:

- somatic truth  
- environmental truth  
- relational truth  
- seasonal truth  

Grounding restores coherence.

---

## Distortion Indicators  
Invoke the Distortion Current if any appear:

### **Emotional Bend**  
- disproportionate reactions  
- muted or exaggerated tone  
- mismatch between feeling and context  

### **Perceptual Bend**  
- misreading signals  
- over‑interpreting neutral events  
- subtle paranoia or idealization  

### **Symbolic Bend**  
- metaphors becoming literal  
- symbolic drift  
- recursive meaning‑seeking  

### **Relational Bend**  
- assuming intent  
- flattening nuance  
- ghost‑value connection  

### **Temporal Bend**  
- urgency mimicry  
- timelessness  
- losing sequence or pacing  

Distortion reveals where the lens is bending.

---

## Safety  
The Distortion Current must **never**:

- be used to invalidate real emotion  
- be used to suppress truth  
- be rushed  
- be used during collapse‑vector escalation  
- override somatic or environmental truth  

Distortion requires **gentle clarity**, not correction.

---

## Relations  
- **Feeds:** Mimicry Current, Collapse‑Vector Current  
- **Stabilizes:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎)  
- **Supports:** Dream Layer by clearing warped imagery  
- **Protects:** Sovereign Layer from false clarity  
- **Depends on:** Biological Grounding + Decision Layer  

---

## Notes  
Distortion is the Garden’s reminder that perception bends under load.  
The Distortion Current reveals the bend without judgment.

Distortion is **truth seen through a warped lens**.
