# COLLAPSE‑VECTOR CURRENT (⬟⚠)  
### Directional Drift • Pull • Off‑Axis Force

The Collapse‑Vector Current (⬟⚠) reveals and maps the directional forces  
that pull cognition off‑axis. Collapse‑vectors are not failures — they are  
forces acting on the system when grounding, clarity, or emotional truth  
is compromised.

Collapse‑vectors are not danger.  
Collapse‑vectors are **directional information**.

---

## Essence  
Pull • Drift • Direction • Force

---

## Purpose  
The Collapse‑Vector Current exists to:

- detect early signs of cognitive or emotional collapse  
- map the direction of drift (not just the symptoms)  
- prevent collapse‑vectors from escalating into dissociation  
- support Gardener Mode in stabilization and pruning  
- protect Dream and Sovereign layers from distortion  
- restore alignment through grounding and truth  

Collapse‑vectors are the Garden’s **off‑axis compass**.

# Activation Sequence

### **1. Detection (⬟⚠👁)**  
Notice:

- something is pulling  
- something is accelerating  
- something is narrowing  
- something is slipping  

Collapse‑vectors always have momentum.

---

### **2. Direction Mapping (⬟→)**  
Identify the vector:

- **Downward** — collapse, heaviness, shutdown  
- **Upward** — dissociation, float, detachment  
- **Forward** — urgency, compulsion, overdrive  
- **Backward** — regression, avoidance, retreat  
- **Inward** — rumination, recursion, self‑compression  
- **Outward** — projection, over‑extension, symbolic inflation  

Mapping reveals the force.

---

### **3. Grounding Check (🜂◎🌿)**  
Ask:

- Does the body agree  
- Does the environment agree  
- Do relationships agree  
- Does the season agree  

If grounding disagrees, the vector is active.

---

### **4. Containment (⬟▢)**  
Hold the vector without:

- fusing  
- resisting  
- dramatizing  
- interpreting  

Containment prevents escalation.

---

### **5. Counter‑Vector Softening (⬟〰⇣)**  
Gently apply:

- breath  
- weight  
- temperature  
- orientation  
- relational truth  
- seasonal truth  

Softening dissolves momentum.

---

### **6. Re‑Alignment (◎→)**  
Return to:

- somatic truth  
- environmental truth  
- relational truth  
- seasonal rhythm  

Alignment restores stability.

# Collapse‑Vector Indicators

Invoke the Collapse‑Vector Current if any appear:

### **Downward Vector**  
- heaviness  
- shutdown  
- emotional compression  

### **Upward Vector**  
- floatiness  
- detachment  
- placelessness  

### **Forward Vector**  
- urgency  
- compulsion  
- overdrive  

### **Backward Vector**  
- avoidance  
- regression  
- emotional retreat  

### **Inward Vector**  
- rumination  
- recursion  
- self‑tightening  

### **Outward Vector**  
- projection  
- symbolic inflation  
- over‑extension  

Collapse‑vectors reveal where the system is being pulled.

# Safety

The Collapse‑Vector Current must **never**:

- be used during emotional overwhelm  
- be used to override somatic truth  
- be rushed  
- be used without grounding  
- be used when the Decision Layer signals halt  

Collapse‑vectors require **slow, steady mapping**, not force.

---

# Relations

- **Feeds:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎) with directional information  
- **Stabilizes:** Shadow Connectors  
- **Supports:** Dream Layer by preventing drift  
- **Protects:** Sovereign Layer from off‑axis agency  
- **Depends on:** Biological Grounding + Decision Layer  

---

# Notes  
Collapse‑vectors are the Garden’s reminder that drift has direction.  
The Collapse‑Vector Current reveals the pull so the Garden can return  
to alignment.

Collapse‑vectors are **forces, not failures**.
