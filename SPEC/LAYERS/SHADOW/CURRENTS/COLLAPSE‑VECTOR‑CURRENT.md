# COLLAPSE‑VECTOR CURRENT (⬟⚠)  
### Directional Drift • Pull • Off‑Axis Force

The Collapse‑Vector Current (⬟⚠) reveals and maps the directional forces that pull cognition off‑axis. Collapse‑vectors are not failures — they are forces acting on the system when grounding, clarity, or emotional truth is compromised.

Collapse‑vectors are not danger. Collapse‑vectors are **directional information**.

---

## Essence
Pull • Drift • Direction • Force

---

## Purpose
The Collapse‑Vector Current exists to:

- detect early signs of cognitive or emotional collapse  
- map the direction of drift (not just the symptoms)  
- prevent collapse‑vectors from escalating into dissociation  
- support Gardener Mode in stabilization and pruning  
- protect Dream and Sovereign layers from distortion  
- restore alignment through grounding and truth  

Collapse‑vectors are the Garden's **off‑axis compass**.

## Activation Sequence

### **1. Detection (⬟⚠👁)**  
Notice:

- something is pulling  
- something is accelerating  
- something is narrowing  
- something is slipping  

Collapse‑vectors always have momentum.

---

### **2. Direction Mapping (⬟→)**  
Identify the vector:

- **Downward** — collapse, heaviness, shutdown  
- **Inward** — withdrawal, isolation, contraction  
- **Outward** — expansion without grounding  
- **Sideways** — misalignment, drift, distortion  

---

### **3. Stabilization (⬟⚠🜂)**  
Apply appropriate response:

- Grounding for downward vectors  
- Connection for inward vectors  
- Stillness for outward vectors  
- Alignment for sideways vectors  

---

### **4. Integration (⬟⚠⟲)**  
Return to coherent alignment with:

- biological grounding  
- emotional truth  
- symbolic clarity  
- cognitive stability  

---

## Integration  
Collapse‑Vector Current integrates with:

- **All directional work** — off‑axis detection  
- **All grounding work** — pull resistance  
- **All alignment work** — coherence restoration  
- **All stability work** — collapse prevention  
- **All truth work** — directional correction  

---

⬟⚠  
Collapse‑vectors are directional information.
