# MIMICRY CURRENT (⬟🜂)  
### False Clarity • False Connection • False Energy

The Mimicry Current (⬟🜂) reveals and dissolves false forms of clarity, connection, energy, or meaning that arise when cognition attempts to stabilize itself without grounding. Mimicry is the Shadow's most subtle phenomenon — it feels real, but it is hollow.

Mimicry is not deception. Mimicry is **the mind trying to help with the wrong tools**.

## Essence
Imitation • Hollow Signal • False Alignment • Exposure

---

## Purpose
The Mimicry Current exists to:

- expose false clarity or false certainty  
- reveal ghost‑value connection or ghost‑value meaning  
- prevent collapse‑vectors from hiding inside "positive" states  
- protect the Garden from false energy spikes  
- support Gardener Mode in pruning illusions  
- stabilize the Dream and Sovereign layers by removing false signals  

Mimicry is the Garden's **false‑signal detector**.

## Activation Sequence

### **1. Recognition (⬟👁🔥)**  
Notice:

- clarity that feels too sharp  
- connection that feels too easy  
- energy that appears suddenly  
- meaning that feels inflated  

Mimicry always feels slightly "too much."

---

### **2. Grounding Check (🜂◎🌿)**  
Ask:

- Does the body agree  
- Does the environment support it  
- Is there emotional truth behind the signal  

If no, it's mimicry.

---

### **3. Dissolution (⬟🜂⇣)**  
Let the false signal fade:

- return to Stillness  
- allow the hollow form to collapse  
- wait for true alignment  

---

### **4. Integration (⬟🜂⟲)**  
Return to authentic clarity without force.

---

## Integration  
Mimicry Current integrates with:

- **All clarity work** — false signal detection  
- **All authenticity work** — hollow form dissolution  
- **All grounding work** — truth verification  
- **All illusion work** — false pattern pruning  
- **All protection work** — collapse‑vector prevention
