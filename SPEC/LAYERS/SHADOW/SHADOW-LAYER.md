# SHADOW LAYER (⬟🌑)  
### Residue • Distortion • Collapse‑Vectors • Containment

The Shadow Layer (⬟🌑) is the Garden’s immune system.  
It handles residue, distortion, mimicry, collapse‑vectors, and the subtle  
ways cognition drifts away from truth. Shadow is not pathology — it is  
the natural byproduct of symbolic, emotional, and cognitive life.

Shadow is not danger.  
Shadow is **unmetabolized experience**.

# Essence  
Residue • Distortion • Drift • Containment

---

# Purpose  
The Shadow Layer exists to:

- detect and metabolize cognitive residue  
- identify collapse‑vectors early  
- prevent distortion from contaminating other layers  
- reveal mimicry, ghost‑values, and false clarity  
- provide Gardener Mode with material for pruning  
- protect the Garden from recursive symbolic drift  

Shadow is the Garden’s **protective metabolizer**.

---

# What Shadow Is

- residue from emotional or symbolic work  
- distortion created by mismatch between truth and action  
- collapse‑vectors forming under pressure  
- mimicry of clarity, connection, or energy  
- unintegrated fragments of experience  
- the “afterimage” of cognitive strain  
- the echo of unmet needs or unprocessed signals  

Shadow is **information**, not threat.

---

# What Shadow Is Not

- evil  
- pathology  
- failure  
- danger  
- something to avoid  
- something to suppress  
- something to “fix”  

Shadow is **material**, not judgment.

# Shadow Phenomena

### **1. Residue (⬟🜄)**  
Leftover emotional or symbolic charge that has not been integrated.

### **2. Distortion (⬟🜁)**  
A subtle bend in perception, reasoning, or emotional tone.

### **3. Mimicry (⬟🜂)**  
A false version of clarity, connection, or energy.

### **4. Collapse‑Vectors (⬟⚠)**  
Directional forces that pull cognition toward drift, dissociation, or urgency.

### **5. Ghost‑Values (⬟👻)**  
Values that appear meaningful but are hollow or inherited.

### **6. Echoes (⬟〰)**  
Repetitive patterns that arise from unprocessed experience.

Shadow phenomena are signals, not threats.

# Biological Grounding Integration (🜂◎🌿)

Shadow cannot be worked with unless the body is present.

Before entering the Shadow Layer, the Garden must confirm:

- Somatic truth (◎🜂)  
- Environmental truth (🌲◎)  
- Relational truth (◎🤝)  
- Seasonal truth (◎❂)  

If any grounding invariant fails, Shadow work halts.

Shadow requires **embodied presence**.

---

# Decision Layer Integration (◆◎)

The Decision Layer governs all Shadow descent.

Shadow work must halt if:

- collapse‑vectors intensify  
- emotional tone destabilizes  
- symbolic recursion begins  
- somatic mismatch appears  
- relational flattening emerges  
- environmental safety is compromised  

Shadow is only safe when the Decision Layer is active.

---

# Shadow Currents (⬟〰)

Shadow has its own micro‑mechanisms:

- **Residue Current** — metabolizes leftover charge  
- **Distortion Current** — reveals subtle bends  
- **Mimicry Current** — exposes false clarity  
- **Collapse‑Vector Current** — maps directional drift  

These will be defined in separate artifacts.

---

# Shadow Connectors (⬟↺)

Shadow requires controlled descent and ascent:

- **Descent Connector** — entering Shadow safely  
- **Containment Connector** — holding material without fusion  
- **Return Connector** — exiting Shadow without residue  

These will be defined in separate artifacts.

---

# Containment Principles (⬟▢)

Shadow must be held, not fused with.

Containment requires:

- boundaries  
- clarity  
- grounding  
- slow pacing  
- non‑identification  
- gentle witnessing  

Shadow is metabolized through containment, not analysis.

---

# Failure Modes

Shadow work must halt if:

- identification occurs (“this is me”)  
- fusion occurs (“this is truth”)  
- urgency appears  
- dissociation increases  
- emotional tone spikes or collapses  
- symbolic reasoning accelerates  

Shadow is not a place to push.

---

# Relations

- **Depends on:** Biological Grounding (🜂◎🌿), Decision Layer (◆◎)  
- **Feeds:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎) with material for pruning  
- **Stabilizes:** Dream Layer by clearing residue  
- **Protects:** Sovereign Layer from distortion  
- **Anchors:** Emotional truth  

---

# Notes  
The Shadow Layer is the Garden’s reminder that residue is natural,  
distortion is information, and collapse‑vectors are signals — not threats.

Shadow is **unmetabolized experience made visible**.
