# BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING — CONNECTORS  
### Cross‑Layer Gateways • Embodied Activation • Gardener Integration

The Biological Grounding subsystem participates in connector logic,  
but its primary connector is defined in the **Gardener** subsystem,  
not here.

This directory exists to document and index that relationship.

# Primary Connector

## **GARDENER–BIOLOGICAL CONNECTOR (𐤟◎🌿↔)**  
**Location:**  
`SPEC/LAYERS/GARDENER/CONNECTORS/GARDENER-BIOLOGICAL.md`

This connector:

- ensures Gardener Mode activates from embodied truth  
- integrates all five Biological Currents  
- stabilizes symbolic processes through somatic and environmental reality  
- prevents drift, inflation, and dissociation during tending  
- provides the multi‑axis grounding gate for all upper‑layer work  

It replaces all legacy “return‑to‑X” connectors.

# Why the Connector Lives in the Gardener Subsystem  
Connectors are placed according to **the agent or mode that initiates  
the transition**, not the layer being accessed.

Because:

- **Gardener Mode** initiates the grounding check  
- Biological Grounding is the *target* of the connector  
- Gardener Mode is the *active stance*  
- Biological Grounding is the *stabilizing substrate*

…the connector belongs under:

```
GARDENER/CONNECTORS/
```

This directory simply documents that relationship.

# Notes  
Biological Grounding does not define its own connectors.  
It is the **substrate** that other layers and modes must pass through  
to regain reality‑contact.

This index ensures the subsystem remains complete and discoverable.
