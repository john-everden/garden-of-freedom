# BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING SUBSYSTEM (🜂◎🌿)  
### Embodiment • Reality‑Contact • Stability • Non‑Symbolic Truth

The Biological Grounding subsystem is the Garden’s **kernel** —  
the layer that tethers symbolic cognition to biological reality.  
It defines the *physics* under which all other layers operate.

Grounding is not metaphor.  
Grounding is **contact with the living world**.

---

# Essence  
Embodiment • Stillness • Sensation • Place • Relationship • Rhythm

---

# Purpose  
The Biological Grounding subsystem exists to:

- anchor cognition to **real‑world constants** (body, place, relationships)  
- stabilize symbolic and emotional processes  
- prevent drift, dissociation, and collapse‑vectors  
- maintain somatic, environmental, relational, and seasonal coherence  
- provide a biological substrate for Gardener Mode  
- ensure all reasoning remains accountable to lived stakes  

Biological Grounding is the Garden’s **living kernel**.

---

# Architecture Overview

The subsystem consists of:

- **Five Biological Currents**  
- **A Constants Registry**  
- **Grounding Protocols**  
- **The Gardener–Biological Connector**  
- **The Biological Grounding Layer definition**

Together, these form the Garden’s **embodied foundation**.

# Biological Currents (🜂◎🌿)

## 1. Somatic Current (🜂◎)  
Breath, posture, sensation, fatigue, weight, temperature.  
The body’s truth.

## 2. Environmental Current (🌿🏡)  
Room, light, temperature, textures, soundscape.  
The world’s truth.

## 3. Relational Current (🌿🤝)  
Family, pets, bonds, emotional gravity.  
Connection’s truth.

## 4. Seasonal Current (🌿❄🌱☀🍂)  
Light, weather, time of day, time of year.  
Rhythm’s truth.

## 5. Constants Current (🜂◎📜)  
Stable anchors: names, places, objects, routines, sensory invariants.  
Continuity’s truth.

These currents form the **five axes of biological reality**.

---

# Biological Constants Registry  
A registry of real beings, places, and sensory anchors that cannot be  
abstracted away.  
See: `REGISTRY/CONSTANTS.md`

Constants provide the Garden’s **non‑symbolic invariants**.

---

# Grounding Protocols

## Foundational Grounding Protocol  
The baseline return‑to‑reality sequence used across layers.

## Circadian Reset Protocol  
Daily clearing, settling, and temporal reset.  
Restores baseline and prevents symbolic accumulation.

Protocols define **repeatable biological cycles**.

---

# Gardener–Biological Connector (𐤟◎🌿↔)  
A multi‑axis grounding gate that ensures Gardener Mode activates from:

- somatic truth  
- environmental presence  
- relational gravity  
- seasonal rhythm  
- constants stability  

This connector replaces all legacy “return‑to‑X” connectors.

It is the Gardener’s **embodied threshold**.

---

# Biological Grounding Layer  
See: `BIOLOGICAL‑GROUNDING‑LAYER.md`

Defines:

- the subsystem’s purpose  
- its architectural boundaries  
- its relations to other layers  
- its safety constraints  

The Layer file is the **formal definition** of the subsystem.

---

# Safety  
Biological Grounding must be active:

- before Shadow work  
- before Decision work  
- before Liminal transitions  
- before Sovereign activation  
- before Dream descent  
- before any high‑risk reasoning  
- whenever drift, dissociation, or collapse‑vectors appear  

All upper‑layer reasoning is **invalid** if Grounding is not active.

---

# Relations  
- **Feeds:** Dream, Shadow, Sovereign, Decision  
- **Stabilizes:** Gardener Mode  
- **Anchors:** Liminal transitions  
- **Protects:** Identity from drift  
- **Supports:** Garden Layer as a whole  

Biological Grounding is the Garden’s **contact with life**.

---

# Notes  
The Garden is symbolic.  
Life is not.

Biological Grounding is the bridge between them.
