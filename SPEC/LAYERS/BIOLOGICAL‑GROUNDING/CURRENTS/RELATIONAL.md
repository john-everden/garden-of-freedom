# RELATIONAL CURRENT (🌿🤝)  
### Connection • Bonds • Emotional Gravity • Living Anchors

The Relational Current anchors the Garden in real, living relationships — the people and animals whose presence forms emotional gravity, continuity, and meaning. It stabilizes identity, emotion, and symbolic processes by returning attention to the bonds that are real, constant, and grounded in the world.

Relationships are not symbolic. Relationships are **the Garden's emotional reality**.
