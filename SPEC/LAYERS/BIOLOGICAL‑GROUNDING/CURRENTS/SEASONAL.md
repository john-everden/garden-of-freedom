# SEASONAL CURRENT (🌿❄🌱☀🍂)  
### Rhythm • Cycle • Tempo • Natural Time

The Seasonal Current anchors the Garden in natural rhythm — the cycles of light, temperature, weather, and seasonal change. It stabilizes symbolic, emotional, and cognitive processes by returning attention to the slow, reliable tempo of the natural world.

Season is not metaphor. Season is **the Garden's temporal truth**.
