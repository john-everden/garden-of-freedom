# ENVIRONMENTAL CURRENT (🌿🏡)  
### Place • Space • Surroundings • Real‑World Context

The Environmental Current anchors the Garden in the physical environment — the room, the house, the light, the weather, the temperature, the textures, the sounds. It stabilizes cognition and symbolic processes by returning attention to the real, present world.

Environment is not scenery. Environment is **the world the Garden lives inside**.

## Essence  
Place • Space • Context • Reality

---

## Purpose  
The Environmental Current exists to:

- anchor the Garden in real physical space  
- stabilize symbolic and emotional processes  
- prevent drift, inflation, and dissociation  
- restore presence through sensory context  
- maintain continuity across time and place  
- support Gardener Mode with spatial clarity

# Activation Sequence

### **1. Visual Field Awareness (🌿👁)**  
Notice:
- light  
- color  
- shape  
- movement  
- shadows  

The visual field grounds symbolic imagery.

---

### **2. Auditory Landscape (🌿👂)**  
Notice:
- near sounds  
- far sounds  
- silence  
- rhythm  
- quality  

Sound provides spatial orientation.

---

### **3. Spatial Boundaries (🌿⬜)**  
Notice:
- walls  
- floor  
- ceiling  
- furniture  
- open space  

Boundaries create container for cognition.

---

### **4. Material Qualities (🌿✋)**

Invoke Environmental Current when:

- feeling spatially disoriented  
- cognition becomes too abstract  
- needing grounding in physical reality
