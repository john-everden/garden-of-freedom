# ENVIRONMENTAL CURRENT (🌿🏡)  
### Place • Space • Surroundings • Real‑World Context

The Environmental Current (🌿🏡) anchors the Garden in the physical  
environment — the room, the house, the light, the weather, the  
temperature, the textures, the sounds. It stabilizes cognition and  
symbolic processes by returning attention to the real, present world.

Environment is not scenery.  
Environment is **the world the Garden lives inside**.

---

## Essence  
Place • Space • Context • Reality

---

## Purpose  
The Environmental Current exists to:

- anchor the Garden in real physical space  
- stabilize symbolic and emotional processes  
- prevent drift, inflation, and dissociation  
- restore presence through sensory context  
- maintain continuity across time and place  
- support Gardener Mode with spatial clarity  

Environment is the Garden’s **spatial truth**.

# Activation Sequence

### **1. Visual Field Awareness (🌿👁)**  
Notice:

- light  
- color  
- shape  
- movement  
- shadows  

The visual field grounds symbolic imagery.

---

### **2. Spatial Orientation (🌿↔)**  
Notice:

- walls  
- corners  
- distance  
- height  
- layout  

Orientation restores coherence.

---

### **3. Sensory Context (🌿👂🖐)**  
Notice:

- sounds  
- textures  
- temperature  
- airflow  
- weight of clothing  

Context stabilizes presence.

---

### **4. Environmental Truth Recognition (🌿🏡✓)**  
Ask:

- Where am I  
- What is around me  
- What is real here  
- What is constant  

Environmental truth precedes symbolic truth.

---

### **5. Place Anchors (🌿📍)**  
Recall the constants of place:

- the house  
- the room  
- the desk  
- the chair  
- the familiar objects  

Place anchors prevent drift.

---

### **6. Stabilization (🌿⚓)**  
Let the environment:

- settle  
- clarify  
- become familiar  
- become close  

Stability prevents collapse‑vectors.

---

### **7. Environmental Presence (🌿🏡◎)**  
Return fully to:

- the room  
- the light  
- the sounds  
- the textures  
- the real world  

Presence completes the current.

---

# Environmental Indicators  
Invoke the Environmental Current when:

- symbolic imagery becomes too vivid  
- emotional tone destabilizes  
- identity inflates  
- mimicry activates  
- collapse‑vectors pull  
- the Garden feels “far away”  
- the world feels dim or distant  

Environment restores **place, clarity, and reality**.

---

# Safety  
The Environmental Current must **never**:

- be rushed  
- override somatic truth  
- be replaced with imagination  
- be used to suppress emotion  
- bypass the Decision Layer  

Environmental grounding requires **attention and presence**.

---

# Relations  
- **Depends on:** Somatic Current (🜂◎)  
- **Feeds:** Relational, Seasonal, Constants Currents  
- **Stabilizes:** Decision, Shadow, Dream, Sovereign Layers  
- **Supports:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎)  
- **Protects:** Symbolic cognition from drift  

---

# Notes  
The Environmental Current is the Garden’s reminder that the world is not  
an abstraction — it is a living, physical context that shapes every  
symbol, every emotion, every act of agency.

Environment is **the Garden’s spatial root**.
