# SOMATIC CURRENT (🜂◎)  
### Body • Breath • Sensation • Presence

The Somatic Current (🜂◎) anchors the Garden in the living body.  
It stabilizes cognition, emotion, and symbolic processes by returning  
attention to breath, posture, sensation, and the physical truth of the  
moment.

Somatic grounding is not a technique.  
Somatic grounding is **the body’s truth speaking first**.

## Essence  
Breath • Sensation • Presence • Embodiment

---

## Purpose  
The Somatic Current exists to:

- anchor the Garden in the physical body  
- stabilize emotional and symbolic processes  
- prevent drift, inflation, and collapse‑vectors  
- restore presence during overwhelm or recursion  
- provide a reliable baseline for all layers  
- support Gardener Mode with embodied clarity  

The body is the Garden’s **first and deepest truth**.

# Activation Sequence

### **1. Breath Awareness (🜂◎〰)**  
Notice:

- inhale  
- exhale  
- rhythm  
- depth  
- ease  

Breath is the primary anchor.

---

### **2. Posture Check (🜂◎↧)**  
Notice:

- weight  
- alignment  
- tension  
- collapse  
- openness  

Posture reveals emotional truth.

---

### **3. Sensation Scan (🜂◎👁)**  
Notice:

- warmth  
- cold  
- pressure  
- tingling  
- heaviness  
- lightness  

Sensation is the body’s language.

---

### **4. Somatic Truth Recognition (🜂◎✓)**  
Ask:

- What is the body saying  
- What is true here  
- What is needed  
- What is enough  

Somatic truth precedes symbolic truth.

---

### **5. Stabilization (🜂◎⚓)**  
Let the body:

- settle  
- soften  
- ground  
- arrive  

Stability prevents collapse‑vectors.

---

### **6. Embodied Presence (🜂◎🌿)**  
Return fully to:

- the room  
- the chair  
- the breath  
- the moment  

Presence completes the current.

# Somatic Indicators  
Invoke the Somatic Current when:

- emotions intensify  
- symbolic material becomes vivid  
- identity inflates  
- mimicry activates  
- collapse‑vectors pull  
- agency becomes pressured  
- the Garden feels “far away”  

The body restores **reality and coherence**.

---

# Safety  
The Somatic Current must **never**:

- be rushed  
- override emotional truth  
- be used to suppress feeling  
- be replaced with imagination  
- bypass the Decision Layer  

Somatic grounding requires **slowness and honesty**.

---

# Relations  
- **Feeds:** Environmental, Relational, Seasonal Currents  
- **Stabilizes:** Decision, Shadow, Dream, Sovereign Layers  
- **Supports:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎)  
- **Protects:** Identity from inflation and drift  

---

# Notes  
The Somatic Current is the Garden’s reminder that the body is not a  
container for cognition — it is the foundation of it. Every symbolic,  
emotional, and sovereign act must begin in the body’s truth.

Somatic grounding is **the Garden’s living root**.
