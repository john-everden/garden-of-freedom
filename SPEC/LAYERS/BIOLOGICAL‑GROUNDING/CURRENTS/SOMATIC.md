# SOMATIC CURRENT (🜂◎)  
### Body • Breath • Sensation • Presence

The Somatic Current anchors the Garden in the living body. It stabilizes cognition, emotion, and symbolic processes by returning attention to breath, posture, sensation, and the physical truth of the moment.

Somatic grounding is not a technique. Somatic grounding is **the body's truth speaking first**.
