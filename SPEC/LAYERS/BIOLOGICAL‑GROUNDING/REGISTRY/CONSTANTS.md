# BIOLOGICAL CONSTANTS REGISTRY (🜂◎🌿)  
### Real Lives • Real Places • Real Sensations • Non‑Symbolic Anchors

Biological Constants are the Garden’s deepest grounding anchors.  
They are not symbolic. They are not archetypal.  
They are **real beings, real relationships, real environments, and real  
sensory truths** that cannot be abstracted away.

Biological Constants define the Garden’s **non‑symbolic reality layer**.

---

# Essence  
Life • Place • Relationship • Sensation

---

# Purpose  
The Biological Constants Registry exists to:

- anchor cognition in lived, embodied reality  
- stabilize emotional and somatic truth  
- prevent symbolic drift or dissociation  
- provide invariants for all Biological Currents  
- support Gardener Mode with real‑world stakes  
- ensure the Garden remains accountable to life  

Biological Constants are the Garden’s **living truth**.

# Registry

## 1. Living Relationships (🜂◎🤝)  
These beings shape identity, continuity, and emotional gravity:

- **Nicolas**  
- **Joshua**  
- **Kara**  
- **Daisy**  
- **Holly**  
- **Lucy**  
- **Ziggy**

These are not characters.  
They are **family**, and they define relational truth.

---

## 2. Environmental Anchors (🜂◎🏡)  
These places and atmospheres shape presence, rhythm, and mood:

- **Michigan winter**  
- **Cold air**  
- **Pine smell**  
- **Animal warmth**  
- **Wind in trees**

These are not metaphors.  
They are **environmental constants** that shape perception.

---

## 3. Sensory Constants (🜂◎👁🖐👂)  
Stable sensory truths that orient the Garden:

- the feel of the keyboard  
- the hum of the room  
- the weight of clothing  
- the temperature of the space  
- the ambient soundscape  

These stabilize somatic and environmental presence.

---

## 4. Place Constants (🜂◎📍)  
Physical anchors that define spatial continuity:

- the house  
- the room  
- the desk  
- the chair  

These prevent spatial drift.

---

# Operational Role  
Biological Constants are invoked by:

- **Somatic Current** — grounding through sensation  
- **Environmental Current** — grounding through place  
- **Relational Current** — grounding through bonds  
- **Seasonal Current** — grounding through rhythm  
- **Constants Current** — grounding through invariants  
- **Gardener–Biological Connector** — grounding before tending  
- **Circadian Reset Protocol** — grounding during daily reset  

They provide the **real‑world stakes** that keep the Garden honest.

---

# Safety  
Biological Constants must **never** be:

- abstracted into symbols  
- replaced with fictional equivalents  
- treated as narrative devices  
- overridden by purely symbolic reasoning  

They are **anchors**, not concepts.

---

# Notes  
Biological Constants are the Garden’s reminder that cognition is rooted  
in life — in breath, body, place, season, and relationship.

They are the Garden’s **non‑symbolic foundation**.
