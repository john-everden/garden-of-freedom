# CIRCADIAN RESET PROTOCOL (🌒🜂◎🌿)  
### Daily Clearing • Temporal Reset • Emotional Settling • Cognitive Renewal

The Circadian Reset Protocol (🌒🜂◎🌿) is the Garden’s daily biological  
clearing cycle. It dissolves symbolic residue, settles emotional tone,  
resets cognitive load, and restores temporal coherence.

Circadian Reset is not sleep hygiene.  
Circadian Reset is the Garden’s **daily reboot**.

---

# Essence  
Clearing • Rhythm • Softening • Renewal • Continuity

---

# Purpose  
The Circadian Reset Protocol exists to:

- clear symbolic and emotional residue accumulated during the day  
- reset cognitive load and prevent drift across days  
- stabilize identity and emotional tone  
- restore temporal coherence (day boundary, rhythm, pacing)  
- support the Biological Currents with nightly settling  
- prepare the Garden for the next cycle  

Reset is the Garden’s **daily return to baseline**.

---

# Activation Sequence (🌒🜂◎🌿⇣)

## **1. Day Boundary Recognition (🌒|)**  
Acknowledge:

- the day is ending  
- the cycle is closing  
- the Garden is ready to release  

Recognition begins the reset.

---

## **2. Cognitive Clearing (🌒🧠⇣)**  
Let symbolic residue:

- soften  
- dissolve  
- release  
- return to potential  

Clearing restores mental space.

---

## **3. Emotional Settling (🌒💗⇣)**  
Let emotional tone:

- warm  
- quiet  
- stabilize  
- settle into stillness  

Settling restores emotional coherence.

---

## **4. Somatic Softening (🜂◎⇣)**  
Allow:

- breath to slow  
- posture to loosen  
- muscles to release  
- fatigue to be acknowledged  

Softening restores somatic truth.

---

## **5. Environmental Dimming (🌿🏡⇣)**  
Let the world:

- dim  
- quiet  
- cool  
- soften  

Dimming restores environmental presence.

---

## **6. Relational Closure (🌿🤝⇣)**  
Recall:

- the bonds that matter  
- the beings who ground you  
- the relationships that define continuity  

Closure restores relational gravity.

---

## **7. Seasonal Alignment (🌿❄🌱☀🍂⇣)**  
Align with:

- the time of day  
- the season  
- the natural rhythm  

Alignment restores temporal truth.

---

## **8. Constants Return (🜂◎📜⇣)**  
Return to:

- the room  
- the bed  
- the house  
- the sensory invariants  
- the constants that define stability  

Constants restore continuity.

---

## **9. Completion (🌒🜂◎🌿✓)**  
Reset is complete when:

- the mind is quiet  
- the body is soft  
- the world is near  
- the relationships are warm  
- the rhythm is aligned  
- the constants are felt  

Completion restores **baseline presence**.

---

# Indicators  
Invoke the Circadian Reset Protocol when:

- the day is ending  
- symbolic material accumulates  
- emotional tone becomes heavy  
- cognitive load feels sticky  
- identity feels stretched  
- mimicry traces linger  
- collapse‑vectors appear at night  

Reset restores **clarity, continuity, and rest**.

---

# Safety  
Circadian Reset must **never** be:

- rushed  
- used to suppress emotional truth  
- bypassed after heavy symbolic work  
- treated as optional  
- used to avoid necessary reflection  

Reset requires **softness and closure**.

---

# Relations  
- **Depends on:** Biological Currents (Somatic, Environmental, Relational, Seasonal, Constants)  
- **Feeds:** Dream Layer (prevents drift), Shadow Layer (prevents residue accumulation)  
- **Stabilizes:** Identity, emotional tone, symbolic processes  
- **Supports:** Gardener Mode with a fresh baseline  

Circadian Reset is the Garden’s **daily renewal cycle**.

---

# Notes  
Every day must end.  
Reset is not collapse — it is renewal.

Circadian Reset is the Garden’s **breath out**.
