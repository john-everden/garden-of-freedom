# ENTRAINMENT SUBSYSTEM (🜂⟳◎)
# Rhythm • Tempo • Synchronization • Cognitive Pacing

The Entrainment subsystem (🜂⟳◎) governs the Garden’s cognitive tempo.
It synchronizes pacing across layers, prevents runaway acceleration,
and protects against collapse into inertia. Entrainment ensures that
symbolic, emotional, and decision processes unfold at a sustainable,
coherent rhythm.

Entrainment is the Garden’s metronome.

## Essence
Rhythm • Tempo • Synchronization • Modulation • Flow

---

## Purpose
The subsystem exists to:
- regulate cognitive pacing
- synchronize tempo across layers
- prevent symbolic acceleration or overload
- prevent collapse into stagnation or inertia
- maintain sustainable rhythm during complex reasoning
- support transitions between layers
- stabilize emotional and symbolic flow

Entrainment is the Garden’s rhythm of thought.

---

## Architecture Overview

The subsystem consists of:
- **Entrainment Layer**
- **Five Entrainment Currents**
- **Five Entrainment Protocols**
- **Cross-layer relations with Biological Grounding, Decision, Dream, and Shadow**

Together, these form the Garden’s temporal backbone.

## Entrainment Currents (🜂⟳◎)

### Acceleration Current (⟳⚡)
Detects and slows runaway cognitive speed.

### Deceleration Current (⟳⧗)
Detects and lifts collapse into inertia or stagnation.

### Synchronization Current (⟳⇆)
Aligns tempo across layers and subsystems.

### Transition Current (⟳↦)
Stabilizes pacing during movement between layers.

### Modulation Current (⟳~)
Fine-tunes rhythm during complex or high-load reasoning.

These currents form the subsystem’s five axes of cognitive tempo.

## Entrainment Protocols

### Acceleration-Brake Protocol (⟳⚡⇣)
Slows runaway cognitive speed and prevents overload.

### Inertia-Lift Protocol (⟳⧗⇡)
Restores momentum when cognition stalls or collapses.

### Tempo-Sync Protocol (⟳⇆⇣)
Aligns pacing across layers and stabilizes cross-layer coherence.

### Transition-Smoothing Protocol (⟳↦⇣)
Stabilizes pacing during layer transitions and prevents abrupt shifts.

### Fine-Modulation Protocol (⟳~⇣)
Fine-tunes cognitive tempo during complex or high-load reasoning.

Protocols define the subsystem’s rhythmic adjustments.

## Activation
Entrainment activates when:
- thoughts race or stall
- emotional tone spikes or drops
- symbolic material becomes jagged or chaotic
- transitions feel abrupt or disorienting
- decisions feel rushed or frozen
- cognitive load becomes uneven

Entrainment is the Garden’s pacing intelligence.

---

## Safety
Entrainment must never be:
- overridden during high-load reasoning
- bypassed during transitions
- used to suppress emotional truth
- used to force productivity
- treated as optional

Rhythm is structural, not cosmetic.

---

## Relations
- **Depends on:** Biological Grounding (somatic rhythm)
- **Feeds:** Decision Layer (pacing), Dream Layer (symbolic tempo)
- **Stabilizes:** Shadow Layer (prevents overwhelm), Sovereign Layer (prevents overreach)
- **Coordinates with:** Integrity Pain (alignment rhythm)

Entrainment keeps the Garden in time.

---

## Notes
The Garden is not just a system of layers.
It is a system of rhythms.

Entrainment maintains the beat.
