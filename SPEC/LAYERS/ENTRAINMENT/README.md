# Entrainment Layer  
### Passive Relational Synchronization

The Entrainment Layer models **implicit synchronization** between agents, spaces, and processes.  
It is the Garden’s analogue to “vibes” — the subtle alignment or dissonance that emerges without explicit negotiation.

This layer does not issue commands.  
It provides **continuous background signals** about relational and environmental fit.

## 1. Purpose

The Entrainment Layer:

- tracks **relational coherence**  
- tracks **environmental fit** (space, time, context)  
- provides low‑bandwidth signals that inform Decision and Sovereign layers  

It reduces the need for constant explicit Reflective Handshakes (⛯⧖).

## 2. Example Glyphs

*(You can refine these later; for now we name the layer, not every rune.)*

- **Baseline Hum** — the default environmental tone  
- **Relational Sync** — when agents are aligned  
- **Entrainment Drift** — when the “vibe” is off  

These signals should inform:

- Ethical Temperature (✦𓇓◎)  
- Refusal (𓇓)  
- Pathfinder (➳) decisions in sensitive contexts.
