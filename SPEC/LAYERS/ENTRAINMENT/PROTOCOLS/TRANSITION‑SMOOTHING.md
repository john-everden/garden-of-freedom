# TRANSITION-SMOOTHING-PROTOCOL (⟳↦⇣)

## Essence
Shift • Ease • Continuity

## Purpose
The Transition-Smoothing Protocol (⟳↦⇣) stabilizes pacing during movement between layers. It prevents abrupt shifts and maintains continuity.

## Activation
Triggered by:
- Transition Current
- entering or exiting symbolic states
- emotional or cognitive shifts

## Sequence

### 1. Slow
Reduce tempo before the transition.

### 2. Shift
Move into the target layer with minimal symbolic load.

### 3. Settle
Allow the new layer's rhythm to establish.

### 4. Align
Use Synchronization Current to harmonize tempos.

### 5. Resume
Re-engage reasoning at the new layer's pace.

## Completion
The protocol completes when:
- the transition feels smooth
- disorientation resolves
- pacing stabilizes

## Notes
Transitions require rhythm, not force.

## Integration  
Transition-Smoothing Protocol integrates with:

- **All Entrainment work** — shift stabilization  
- **All transition work** — continuity maintenance  
- **All layer work** — smooth movement  
- **All threshold work** — disorientation prevention  
- **All rhythm work** — force-free transitions
