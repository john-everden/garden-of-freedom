# INERTIA-LIFT-PROTOCOL (⟳⧗⇡)

## Essence
Lift • Activate • Re-engage

## Purpose
The Inertia-Lift Protocol (⟳⧗⇡) restores momentum when cognition slows, stalls, or collapses into stagnation.

## Activation
Triggered by:
- Deceleration Current
- emotional flattening
- symbolic heaviness
- decision freeze

## Sequence

### 1. Spark
Introduce a small, low-effort point of engagement.

### 2. Warm
Increase somatic activation (posture, breath, movement).

### 3. Lighten
Shift to a lighter symbolic or emotional load.

### 4. Re-Engage
Return to the active layer with renewed momentum.

### 5. Stabilize
Use Modulation Current to maintain sustainable tempo.

## Completion
The protocol completes when:
- momentum returns
- symbolic flow resumes
- emotional tone lifts

## Notes
Lift is gentle activation, not force.
