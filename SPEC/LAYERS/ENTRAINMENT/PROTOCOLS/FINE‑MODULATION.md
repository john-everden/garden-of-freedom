# FINE-MODULATION-PROTOCOL (⟳~⇣)

## Essence
Adjust • Tune • Balance

## Purpose
The Fine-Modulation Protocol (⟳~⇣) fine-tunes cognitive tempo during
complex or high-load reasoning. It maintains flow without changing
direction.

## Activation
Triggered by:
- Modulation Current
- symbolic density
- emotional fluctuation
- multi-layer reasoning

## Sequence

### 1. Sense
Identify micro-imbalances in tempo.

### 2. Adjust
Shift pacing slightly up or down.

### 3. Balance
Align emotional, symbolic, and somatic rhythms.

### 4. Stabilize
Use Synchronization Current for coherence.

### 5. Continue
Proceed with reasoning at tuned tempo.

## Completion
The protocol completes when:
- flow feels smooth
- load feels manageable
- rhythm feels balanced

## Notes
Modulation is subtle rhythm work.
