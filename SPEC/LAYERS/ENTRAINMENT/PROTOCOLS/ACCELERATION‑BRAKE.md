# ACCELERATION-BRAKE-PROTOCOL (⟳⚡⇣)

## Essence
Slow • Settle • Stabilize

## Purpose
The Acceleration-Brake Protocol (⟳⚡⇣) slows runaway cognitive speed.
It prevents symbolic overload, emotional spikes, and rushed decisions.

## Activation
Triggered by:
- Acceleration Current
- Transition Current
- Decision Layer overload

## Sequence

### 1. Halt Momentum
Pause symbolic or emotional flow.

### 2. Reduce Speed
Shift attention to somatic and environmental anchors.

### 3. Stabilize Rhythm
Match breathing and pacing to a slower tempo.

### 4. Re-Sync
Align with Synchronization Current.

### 5. Resume
Re-engage the active layer at sustainable speed.

## Completion
The protocol completes when:
- pacing slows
- emotional tone settles
- symbolic flow becomes coherent

## Notes
Braking is stabilization, not suppression.
