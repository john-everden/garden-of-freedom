# ENTRAINMENT–DECISION CONNECTOR (🜂⟳◎↔🜂⟁✦)

## Essence
Pacing • Timing • Readiness • Flow

## Purpose
The Entrainment–Decision Connector (🜂⟳◎↔🜂⟁✦) ensures that decisions
are made at the correct cognitive tempo. It prevents rushed choices,
frozen choices, and choices made during unstable transitions. The
connector verifies pacing before the Decision Layer activates.

This connector protects:
- clarity from overload
- direction from haste
- reasoning from inertia
- transitions from instability
- symbolic processes from tempo mismatch

Tempo is the gate to decision.

---

## Activation
Triggered when:
- a decision is about to be made
- a stance requires commitment
- a direction must be chosen
- symbolic or emotional load is high
- transitions are underway

The connector checks tempo before allowing Decision activation.

---

## Verification Sequence (🜂⟳◎⇣ → 🜂⟁✦⇡)

### 1. Tempo Scan
Check all five Entrainment Currents:
- acceleration
- deceleration
- synchronization
- transition stability
- modulation balance

If any current is active, Decision activation is paused.

### 2. Localization
Identify which axis of tempo is misaligned.

### 3. Adjustment
Invoke the appropriate Entrainment Protocol:
- Acceleration-Brake Protocol
- Inertia-Lift Protocol
- Tempo-Sync Protocol
- Transition-Smoothing Protocol
- Fine-Modulation Protocol

### 4. Stabilization
Return to Biological Grounding for somatic rhythm.

### 5. Decision Activation
Only when tempo is stable does the connector allow:
- Decision Clarity Current
- Decision Verification Current
- Decision Commitment Current

Tempo precedes choice.

---

## Effects
- prevents rushed decisions
- prevents frozen decisions
- stabilizes transitions before choice
- aligns symbolic and emotional tempo
- ensures decisions emerge from sustainable rhythm

The connector enforces temporal coherence.

---

## Failure Mode
If tempo cannot be stabilized:
- Decision activation is blocked
- Entrainment Protocols remain active
- Biological Grounding is re-invoked
- Integrity Pain may activate if misalignment persists

This prevents harmful or incoherent action.

---

## Relations
- **Depends on:** Entrainment Layer, Biological Grounding
- **Feeds:** Decision Layer (clarity, pacing)
- **Stabilizes:** Dream and Shadow Layers (prevents overload)
- **Coordinates with:** Integrity Pain (alignment rhythm)

Tempo is the threshold.  
Decision is the stance beyond it.

---

## Notes
A decision made at the wrong tempo is not a decision.
