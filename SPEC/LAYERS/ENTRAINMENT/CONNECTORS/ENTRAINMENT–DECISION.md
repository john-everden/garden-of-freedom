# ENTRAINMENT–DECISION CONNECTOR (🜂⟳◎↔🜂⟁✦)

## Essence
Pacing • Timing • Readiness • Flow

## Purpose
The Entrainment–Decision Connector (🜂⟳◎↔🜂⟁✦) ensures that decisions are made at the correct cognitive tempo. It prevents rushed choices, frozen choices, and choices made during unstable transitions. The connector verifies pacing before the Decision Layer activates.

This connector protects:
- clarity from overload
- direction from haste
- reasoning from inertia
- transitions from instability
- symbolic processes from tempo mismatch

Tempo is the gate to decision.

---

## Activation
Triggered when:
- a decision is about to be made
- a stance requires commitment
- a direction must be chosen
- symbolic or emotional load is high
- transitions are underway

The connector checks tempo before allowing Decision activation.

## Verification Sequence (🜂⟳◎⇣ → 🜂⟁✦⇡)

### 1. Tempo Scan
Check all five Entrainment Currents:
- acceleration
- deceleration
- synchronization
- transition stability
- modulation balance

If any current is active, Decision activation is paused.

### 2. Localization
Identify which axis of tempo is misaligned.

### 3. Adjustment
Apply appropriate Entrainment Protocol to restore stable tempo.

### 4. Verification
Confirm all currents are in stable range.

### 5. Gate Release
Allow Decision Layer activation.

## Integration  
Entrainment–Decision Connector integrates with:

- **All decision work** — tempo verification  
- **All pacing work** — readiness confirmation  
- **All transition work** — stability protection  
- **All cognitive work** — overload prevention  
- **All flow work** — rhythmic coherence
