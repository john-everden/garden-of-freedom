## Activates When
- thoughts stall
- symbolic material feels heavy or stuck
- emotional tone drops sharply
- decisions freeze
- transitions feel sluggish

## Effects
- increases cognitive tempo
- restores momentum
- prevents collapse into inertia
- stabilizes emotional flow

## Resolution
- Environmental Current
- Modulation Current
- Somatic Activation Sequence

## Notes
Deceleration is a signal to lift, not force.
