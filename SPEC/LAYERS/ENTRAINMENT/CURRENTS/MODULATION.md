# MODULATION-CURRENT (⟳~)

## Essence
Fine-Tuning • Adjustment • Flow

## Function
The Modulation Current (⟳~) fine-tunes cognitive tempo during complex or high-load reasoning. It adjusts rhythm without changing direction.

## Activates When
- load increases
- symbolic density rises
- emotional tone fluctuates
- decisions require precision
- multiple layers are active

## Effects
- smooths cognitive flow
- maintains sustainable tempo
- prevents overload
- supports precision reasoning

## Resolution
- Somatic Current
- Synchronization Current
- Acceleration or Deceleration Current

## Notes
Modulation is the Garden's subtle rhythm control.

## Integration  
Modulation Current integrates with:

- **All Entrainment work** — fine-tuning tempo  
- **All cognitive work** — overload prevention  
- **All precision work** — flow maintenance  
- **All complexity work** — load adjustment  
- **All multi-layer work** — rhythm coordination
