# ACCELERATION-CURRENT (⟳⚡)

## Essence
Speed • Momentum • Overload

## Function
The Acceleration Current (⟳⚡) detects runaway cognitive speed. It slows symbolic, emotional, or decision processes that exceed sustainable tempo.

## Activates When
- thoughts race
- symbolic material cascades too quickly
- emotional tone spikes
- decisions feel rushed
- transitions become abrupt

## Effects
- reduces cognitive speed
- restores pacing
- prevents overwhelm
- stabilizes symbolic flow

## Resolution
- Somatic Current
- Modulation Current
- Foundational Grounding Protocol

## Notes
Acceleration is a signal to slow, not stop.

## Integration  
Acceleration Current integrates with:

- **All Entrainment work** — speed regulation  
- **All cognitive work** — overload prevention  
- **All pacing work** — tempo restoration  
- **All flow work** — symbolic stabilization  
- **All transition work** — abruptness prevention
