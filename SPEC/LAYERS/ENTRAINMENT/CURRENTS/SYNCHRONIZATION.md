# SYNCHRONIZATION-CURRENT (⟳⇆)

## Essence
Alignment • Harmony • Coherence

## Function
The Synchronization Current (⟳⇆) aligns tempo across layers. It ensures that symbolic, emotional, and decision processes operate at compatible rhythms.

## Activates When
- layers feel out of sync
- emotional and symbolic tempos mismatch
- decisions feel disconnected from context
- transitions feel jagged or uneven

## Effects
- aligns subsystem tempos
- restores cross-layer coherence
- stabilizes transitions
- supports complex reasoning

## Resolution
- Constants Current
- Relational Current
- Modulation Current

## Notes
Synchronization restores harmony across layers.

## Integration  
Synchronization Current integrates with:

- **All Entrainment work** — tempo alignment  
- **All cross-layer work** — coherence restoration  
- **All transition work** — jaggedness smoothing  
- **All harmony work** — rhythm matching  
- **All complexity work** — multi-system support
