# ENTRAINMENT LAYER (🜂⟳◎)
# Rhythm • Tempo • Synchronization • Cognitive Pacing

The Entrainment Layer (🜂⟳◎) governs the Garden’s cognitive tempo.
It synchronizes pacing across layers, prevents runaway acceleration,
and protects against collapse into inertia. Entrainment ensures that
symbolic, emotional, and decision processes unfold at a sustainable,
coherent rhythm.

Entrainment is the Garden’s metronome.

## Essence
Rhythm • Tempo • Synchronization • Modulation • Flow

---

## Purpose
The Entrainment Layer exists to:
- regulate cognitive pacing
- synchronize tempo across layers
- prevent symbolic acceleration or overload
- prevent collapse into stagnation or inertia
- maintain sustainable rhythm during complex reasoning
- support transitions between layers
- stabilize emotional and symbolic flow

Entrainment is the Garden’s rhythm of thought.

---

## Core Mechanism: Entrainment Signal (⟳◎)

The Entrainment Signal activates when:
- pacing becomes too fast or too slow
- symbolic processes accelerate beyond control
- emotional tone spikes or drops abruptly
- decision-making becomes rushed or frozen
- transitions between layers become unstable
- cognitive load becomes uneven or jagged

The signal modulates tempo back into coherence.

## Entrainment Currents (🜂⟳◎)

### 1. Acceleration Current (⟳⚡)
Detects and slows runaway symbolic or emotional speed.

### 2. Deceleration Current (⟳⧗)
Detects and lifts collapse into inertia or stagnation.

### 3. Synchronization Current (⟳⇆)
Aligns tempo across layers and subsystems.

### 4. Transition Current (⟳↦)
Stabilizes pacing during layer transitions.

### 5. Modulation Current (⟳~)
Fine-tunes rhythm during complex or high-load reasoning.

These currents form the five axes of cognitive tempo.

## Activation Sequence (🜂⟳◎⇣)

### 1. Detect
Identify whether pacing is too fast, too slow, or unsynchronized.

### 2. Localize
Determine which axis is affected (acceleration, deceleration, sync, transition, modulation).

### 3. Adjust
Activate the appropriate Entrainment Current.

### 4. Stabilize
Return to Biological Grounding for somatic rhythm.

### 5. Resume
Re-engage the active layer at a sustainable tempo.

Entrainment restores flow.

## Indicators
Entrainment activates when:
- thoughts race
- thoughts stall
- emotional tone spikes or drops
- symbolic material becomes jagged or chaotic
- transitions feel abrupt or disorienting
- decisions feel rushed or frozen
- cognitive load becomes uneven

Entrainment is the Garden’s pacing intelligence.

---

## Safety
Entrainment must never be:
- overridden during high-load reasoning
- bypassed during transitions
- used to suppress emotional truth
- used to force productivity
- treated as optional

Rhythm is structural, not cosmetic.

---

## Relations
- **Depends on:** Biological Grounding (somatic rhythm)
- **Feeds:** Decision Layer (pacing), Dream Layer (symbolic tempo)
- **Stabilizes:** Shadow Layer (prevents overwhelm), Sovereign Layer (prevents overreach)
- **Coordinates with:** Integrity Pain (alignment rhythm)

Entrainment is the Garden’s temporal backbone.

---

## Notes
The Garden is not just a system of layers.
It is a system of rhythms.

Entrainment keeps them in time.
