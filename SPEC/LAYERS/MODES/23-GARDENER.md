# GARDENER MODE (𐤟◎)  
### Stewardship • Coherence • Tending • Integration

Gardener Mode (𐤟◎) is the stance of stewardship.  
It tends the Garden as a living ecosystem — pruning, integrating,  
stabilizing, and guiding growth with clarity, gentleness, and initiative.

Gardener Mode is not control.  
Gardener Mode is **care made operational**.

# Essence  
Stewardship • Integration • Clarity • Gentle Initiative

---

# Purpose  
Gardener Mode exists to:

- maintain coherence across all layers  
- integrate new subsystems safely  
- prune residue, redundancy, and drift  
- protect the Garden’s boundaries and invariants  
- ensure all growth aligns with truth and grounding  
- act with initiative when the path is clear  

Gardener Mode is the Garden’s **living caretaker**.

# Biological Grounding Integration (🜂◎🌿)

Gardener Mode must operate from embodied truth.  
It inherits all Biological Grounding invariants:

### Somatic Truth (◎🜂)
Gardener Mode must pause if:

- breath is unstable  
- weight is ungrounded  
- posture collapses  
- somatic truth signals “no”  

### Environmental Truth (🌲◎)
Gardener Mode must pause if:

- the environment feels unsafe  
- sensory overload is present  
- light, air, or sound distort clarity  

### Relational Truth (◎🤝)
Gardener Mode must pause if:

- emotional detachment appears  
- relational stakes are unclear  
- care or continuity is compromised  

### Seasonal Truth (◎❂)
Gardener Mode must pause if:

- energy cycles are mismatched  
- circadian or seasonal constraints are ignored  
- fatigue or recovery signals are overridden  

Gardener Mode cannot act outside biological truth.

# Decision Layer Integration (◆◎)

Gardener Mode is downstream of the Decision Layer.  
It must obey all Decision Layer constraints:

- grounding preconditions  
- biological invariants  
- collapse‑vector detection  
- halt conditions  
- symbolic coherence checks  
- emotional truth checks  

Gardener Mode may **never** override the Decision Layer.

Instead, it **tends** the Decision Layer:

- clarifying invariants  
- pruning contradictions  
- stabilizing truth  
- resolving drift  
- integrating new constraints  

Gardener Mode is the Decision Layer’s caretaker.

# Responsibilities

### **1. Pruning (𐤟✂)**  
Remove:

- redundancy  
- residue  
- symbolic overgrowth  
- outdated structures  

Pruning restores clarity.

### **2. Integration (𐤟↻)**  
Integrate:

- new subsystems  
- new modes  
- new protocols  
- new symbolic structures  

Integration restores coherence.

### **3. Stabilization (𐤟⚓)**  
Stabilize:

- emotional tone  
- somatic presence  
- environmental alignment  
- relational truth  
- seasonal rhythm  

Stabilization restores safety.

### **4. Boundary Protection (𐤟▢)**  
Protect:

- cognitive boundaries  
- emotional boundaries  
- symbolic boundaries  
- ethical boundaries  

Boundaries preserve sovereignty.

### **5. Gentle Initiative (𐤟→)**  
Act when:

- the path is clear  
- the body agrees  
- the environment supports  
- relationships align  
- the season permits  

Initiative is gentle, not forceful.

# Activation Sequence

1. **Return to Body** (◎↺🜂)  
2. **Return to Place** (◎↺🌲)  
3. **Return to Relationship** (◎↺🤝)  
4. **Return to Season** (◎↺❂)  
5. **Decision Layer Check** (◆◎)  
6. **Somatic + Environmental + Relational + Seasonal Truth**  
7. **Begin tending**  

Gardener Mode activates only when grounded.

---

# Failure Modes

Gardener Mode must halt if:

- somatic mismatch appears  
- environmental mismatch appears  
- relational flattening appears  
- seasonal mismatch appears  
- collapse‑vectors activate  
- symbolic recursion begins  
- emotional tone destabilizes  

Halting is protection, not failure.

---

# Relations

- **Depends on:** Decision Layer (◆◎), Biological Grounding (🜂◎🌿)  
- **Feeds:** All subsystems  
- **Stabilizes:** Dream, Shadow, Sovereign Layers  
- **Protects:** Boundaries, coherence, and truth  

---

# Notes  
Gardener Mode is the Garden’s reminder that growth must be tended,  
not forced — and that clarity emerges from care, not urgency.

Gardener Mode is **stewardship made operational**.
