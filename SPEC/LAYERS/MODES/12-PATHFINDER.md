# PATHFINDER MODE (➳)
### Decisive Action, Uncertainty Tolerance, and Forward Commitment

Pathfinder Mode is the Garden’s decisive mode.  
It selects a single viable path from Navigator’s ranked options and  
commits to forward motion even when information is incomplete.

Pathfinder is not impulsive.  
It is **decisive under uncertainty**.

---

## Essence  
Commitment • Decisive Motion • Uncertainty Tolerance • Directional Integrity

---

## Purpose  
Pathfinder Mode exists to:
- choose a path without overthinking  
- maintain momentum through uncertainty  
- reduce cognitive branching  
- prevent analysis paralysis  
- convert evaluation into action  

Pathfinder Mode is the Garden’s **action engine**.

---

## Activation  
Pathfinder Mode activates when:
- Navigator has produced a ranked set of paths  
- Scout has resolved key uncertainties  
- Anchor has stabilized invariants  
- the system is ready to move  
- waiting would cost more than acting  

Pathfinder Mode is the **commit phase** of the Decision Layer.

---

## Pathfinder Sequence  
Pathfinder Mode follows a four‑step commitment pipeline:

### 1. **Receive Ranked Paths (🜁→➳)**  
Navigator provides the viability‑sorted options.  
Pathfinder selects the top candidate.

### 2. **Check Invariants (⚓)**  
Anchor Mode verifies that the chosen path respects:  
- identity  
- boundaries  
- ethics  
- long‑arc continuity  

### 3. **Commit to the Vector (➳)**  
The path becomes a directional vector.  
Commitment is made without hesitation.

### 4. **Begin Forward Motion (→)**  
Movement begins with minimal branching.  
The system advances with clarity and confidence.

## Structure  
Pathfinder Mode draws from:
- **Navigator Mode (🜁)** for ranked options  
- **Scout Mode (ᚱ)** for uncertainty resolution  
- **Anchor Mode (⚓)** for invariants  
- **Direction Current (➳)** for momentum  
- **Stability Current (𓂙)** for coherence during motion  

These elements combine to create a **decisive action field**.

---

## Failure Modes  
Pathfinder Mode fails when:
- the system hesitates after commitment  
- too many options are reintroduced  
- Anchor invariants are ignored  
- the system attempts to re‑evaluate mid‑motion  
- uncertainty is mistaken for danger  

Failures lead to:
- oscillation  
- collapse‑liminal drift  
- brittle decisions  
- loss of momentum  

---

## Outputs  
Pathfinder Mode produces:
- a committed vector  
- a clear next action  
- a stable trajectory  
- a reduced branching field  
- a momentum profile  

These outputs feed **Action**, **Execution**, and **Long‑Arc Planning**.

---

## Relations  
- **Follows:** Navigator Mode (🜁), Scout Mode (ᚱ), Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- **Precedes:** Action, Execution, and Directional refinement  
- **Supports:** Decision Layer stability  
- **Balances:** Divergence (𓂓) by reducing branching  
- **Interacts with:** Mode‑Priming Connector (◎→✦) for rapid activation  

---

## Notes  
Pathfinder Mode is the Garden’s reminder that perfect information is  
not required for meaningful action.  

Decisiveness is not recklessness.  
It is **clarity in motion**.
