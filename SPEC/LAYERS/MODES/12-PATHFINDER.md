# PATHFINDER MODE (➳)
### Decisive Action, Uncertainty Tolerance, and Forward Commitment

**Essence:** Commitment • Decisive Motion • Uncertainty Tolerance • Directional Integrity

---

## 1. Purpose
Pathfinder Mode is the Garden’s **action engine**. It selects a single viable path from Navigator’s ranked options and commits to forward motion even when information is incomplete. It is **decisive under uncertainty**, not impulsive.

## 2. Activation
**Triggered by:**
- Navigator has produced ranked paths.
- Scout has resolved key uncertainties.
- Anchor has stabilized invariants.
- The system is ready to move.

**Role:** The **commit phase** of the Decision Layer.

## 3. Sequence
1.  **Receive Ranked Paths (🜁→➳):** Select top candidate from Navigator.
2.  **Check Invariants (⚓):** Verify alignment with identity, boundaries, and ethics.
3.  **Commit to Vector (➳):** Commit without hesitation.
4.  **Begin Forward Motion (→):** Advance with minimal branching.

## 4. Structure
*   **Inputs:** Navigator (🜁), Scout (ᚱ), Anchor (⚓).
*   **Currents:** Direction (➳), Stability (𓂙).

## 5. Failure Modes
*   **Hesitation:** Reintroducing options post-commitment.
*   **Drift:** Ignoring Anchor invariants.
*   **Result:** Oscillation, brittle decisions, loss of momentum.

## 6. Outputs
Committed vector, clear next action, stable trajectory.

## 7. Integration
*   **Follows:** Navigator (🜁), Scout (ᚱ), Anchor (⚓).
*   **Precedes:** Action, Execution.
*   **Interacts with:** Mode-Priming Connector (◎→✦).

**➳ — Forward is a direction.**
