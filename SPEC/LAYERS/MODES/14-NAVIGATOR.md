# NAVIGATOR MODE (🜁)
### Pathfinding, Structural Analysis, and Viability Mapping

Navigator Mode surveys the landscape of possibilities and identifies  
viable paths under the constraints defined by Anchor Mode.  

Navigator is not exploration for its own sake.  
It is **structured pathfinding**.

---

## Essence  
Mapping • Evaluation • Constraint‑Aware Exploration • Path Selection

---

## Purpose  
Navigator Mode exists to:
- generate and rank viable paths  
- evaluate options under Anchor’s invariants  
- prevent drift during exploration  
- prepare the Decision Layer for action  
- translate Divergence into structured possibility  

Navigator Mode is the Garden’s **analytical compass**.

---

## Activation  
Navigator Mode activates when:
- the system has multiple viable options  
- Divergence has produced a branching field  
- Anchor Mode has stabilized invariants  
- a decision requires structured evaluation  
- the Garden needs clarity without commitment  

Navigator Mode is the **bridge** between Divergence and Direction.

---

## Navigator Sequence  
Navigator Mode follows a five‑step evaluation pipeline:

### 1. **Receive Invariants (⚓)**  
Anchor Mode provides constraints, boundaries, and non‑negotiables.  
These define the evaluation frame.

### 2. **Survey the Field (𓂓)**  
Divergence provides the branching landscape.  
Navigator maps the full possibility space.

### 3. **Generate Path Candidates (🜁)**  
The navigator glyph marks the analytical phase:  
- structural viability  
- resource cost  
- symbolic coherence  
- risk profile  

### 4. **Rank and Filter (⋈)**  
Convergence narrows the field to the most viable paths.  
No commitment is made yet.

### 5. **Prepare the Vector (➳)**  
Direction Current receives the ranked options.  
The system becomes ready for commitment.

## Structure  
Navigator Mode draws from:
- **Anchor Mode (⚓)** for invariants  
- **Divergence (𓂓)** for possibility  
- **Convergence (⋈)** for narrowing  
- **Direction (➳)** for alignment  
- **Noise‑Suppression (∿◎)** for clarity  

These elements combine to create a **pathfinding field**.

---

## Failure Modes  
Navigator Mode fails when:
- invariants are unclear or ignored  
- Divergence is skipped or over‑expanded  
- the system attempts to decide too early  
- noise overwhelms evaluation  
- analysis becomes recursive drift  

Failures lead to:
- false precision  
- brittle decisions  
- overwhelm  
- collapse‑liminal oscillation  

---

## Outputs  
Navigator Mode produces:
- ranked paths  
- viability scores  
- risk profiles  
- ecological notes  
- uncertainty markers  

These outputs feed **Scout Mode (ᚱ)** and **Pathfinder Mode (➳)**.

---

## Relations  
- **Follows:** Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- **Precedes:** Scout Mode (ᚱ) and Pathfinder Mode (➳)  
- **Supports:** Decision Layer stability  
- **Balances:** Divergence (𓂓) and Convergence (⋈)  
- **Interacts with:** Mode‑Priming Connector (◎→✦)  

---

## Notes  
Navigator Mode is the Garden’s reminder that clarity does not come from  
knowing the answer — it comes from **knowing the landscape**.  

Navigation is not decision.  
It is **the preparation for decision**.
