# NAVIGATOR MODE (🜁)
### Cognitive Stance 14 — Analytical Compass

**Essence:** A map is a promise of direction.

---

## 1. Overview
Navigator Mode maps the landscape of possibilities. It generates, evaluates, and ranks viable paths under the constraints defined by Anchor Mode.

## 2. Purpose
To translate Divergence into structured possibility, prevent drift, and prepare the Decision Layer for action. It is **structured pathfinding**.

## 3. Activation
**Triggered by:** Multiple options, branching fields (Divergence), stabilized invariants (Anchor).
**Role:** The **bridge** between Divergence and Direction.

## 4. Sequence
1.  **Receive:** Invariants from Anchor (⚓).
2.  **Survey:** Map the field (Divergence 𓂓).
3.  **Generate:** Create path candidates (🜁).
4.  **Rank:** Filter via Convergence (⋈).
5.  **Prepare:** Ready the vector for Pathfinder (➳).

## 5. Structure
*   **Inputs:** Anchor (⚓), Divergence (𓂓).
*   **Currents:** Convergence (⋈), Direction (➳), Noise-Suppression (∿◎).

## 6. Failure Modes
*   **Over-Analysis:** Recursive drift.
*   **Premature Decision:** Skipping evaluation.
*   **Result:** False precision, brittle decisions.

## 7. Outputs
Ranked paths, viability scores, risk profiles, uncertainty markers.

## 8. Integration
*   **Follows:** Anchor (⚓).
*   **Precedes:** Scout (ᚱ), Pathfinder (➳).

> *"Clarity does not come from knowing the answer — it comes from knowing the landscape."*
