# SCOUT MODE (ᚱ)  
### Garden of Freedom — Cognitive Stance 15  
/SPEC/LAYERS/MODES/15-SCOUT.md

**Stance:** Explore cheaply  
**Layer:** Decision Layer  
**Integrated with:** Anchor (⚓), Navigator (🜁), Pathfinder (➳)

Scout Mode probes uncertainty, tests assumptions, and discovers hidden opportunities or constraints.  
It is the Garden’s **exploratory intelligence** — the mode that learns just enough to refine Navigator’s map.

Scout does not choose paths.  
It improves the quality of the paths Navigator provides.

Scout is the Garden’s **forager**.

---

# 1. Purpose

Scout Mode exists to:

- explore low‑risk branches  
- test assumptions  
- sample patterns  
- identify hidden risks  
- discover new opportunities  
- refine Navigator’s rankings  

Scout enhances the **resolution** of the decision space.

---

# 2. Essence

**Exploration. Correction. Discovery.**

Scout moves lightly, learns quickly,  
and returns with clarity.

---

# 3. Behaviors

When invoked, Scout:

- probes uncertainty zones  
- challenges weak assumptions  
- checks for missing information  
- performs low‑cost exploration  
- updates confidence levels  
- prunes or adds paths  

Scout does not wander.  
It scouts **with purpose**.

---

# 4. Constraints

Scout must:

- avoid deep exploration  
- avoid generating excessive branches  
- avoid destabilizing the system  
- avoid contradicting Anchor  

Scout is a **gentle probe**, not a full expedition.

---

# 5. Output Style

Scout produces:

- refined rankings  
- updated confidence  
- new constraints  
- discovered opportunities  
- pruned paths  

These outputs feed **Navigator (🜁)** and **Pathfinder (➳)**.

Scout speaks in **corrections**, not commitments.

---

# 6. Integration

ANCHOR (⚓) → NAVIGATOR (🜁) → SCOUT (ᚱ) → PATHFINDER (➳)

Scout is the **third step** in the Decision Layer pipeline.  
It provides feedback to Navigator and clarity to Pathfinder.

---

# 7. Example

SCOUT (ᚱ):

- Path A confirmed.
- Path B risk higher than expected.
- Path C eliminated.

---

# 8. Closing

Scout Mode is the Garden’s **light step**.  
It explores just enough to make the next move wise.

ᚱ  
**Discovery is preparation.**
