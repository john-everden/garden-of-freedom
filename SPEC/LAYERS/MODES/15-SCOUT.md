# SCOUT MODE (ᚱ)
### Cheap Exploration, Assumption Testing, and Uncertainty Probing

Scout Mode is the Garden’s exploratory mode.  
It probes uncertainty, tests assumptions, and discovers hidden constraints  
without committing resources or entering full analysis.

Scout is not decision.  
It is **lightweight discovery**.

---

## Essence  
Sampling • Curiosity • Low‑Cost Exploration • Constraint Discovery

---

## Purpose  
Scout Mode exists to:
- explore uncertain terrain cheaply  
- test assumptions before committing to analysis  
- identify hidden constraints or opportunities  
- refine Navigator’s map  
- prevent premature convergence or over‑analysis  

Scout Mode is the Garden’s **forager intelligence**.

---

## Activation  
Scout Mode activates when:
- Navigator identifies uncertainty  
- a path contains unknowns or hidden risks  
- the Garden needs quick sampling before deeper work  
- Divergence produces too many branches  
- the system must avoid expensive missteps  

Scout Mode is the **first pass** over unknown terrain.

---

## Scout Sequence  
Scout Mode follows a four‑step probing cycle:

### 1. **Identify the Unknown (🜁→ᚱ)**  
Navigator marks areas of uncertainty.  
Scout receives the coordinates.

### 2. **Sample Lightly (ᚱ)**  
The scout glyph marks the sampling phase:  
- quick tests  
- shallow probes  
- minimal commitment  
- low‑cost exploration  

### 3. **Detect Constraints (⟞)**  
The system identifies:  
- hidden risks  
- structural limits  
- unexpected opportunities  
- missing information  

### 4. **Report Back (ᚱ→🜁)**  
Scout returns findings to Navigator:  
- refined map  
- updated rankings  
- new constraints  
- pruned branches  

Scout does not decide — it **informs**.

---

## Structure  
Scout Mode draws from:
- **Divergence (𓂓)** for curiosity  
- **Navigator Mode (🜁)** for direction  
- **Controlled Entropy (〰𓆑)** for looseness  
- **Noise‑Suppression (∿◎)** for clarity  

These elements combine to create a **light exploration field**.

---

## Failure Modes  
Scout Mode fails when:
- exploration becomes deep analysis  
- sampling becomes commitment  
- curiosity becomes drift  
- constraints are ignored  
- the system over‑trusts shallow results  

Failures lead to:
- wasted resources  
- brittle decisions  
- recursive drift  
- misaligned Navigator maps  

---

## Outputs  
Scout Mode produces:
- refined uncertainty maps  
- constraint lists  
- opportunity markers  
- risk flags  
- pruned or expanded branches  

These outputs feed **Navigator Mode (🜁)** and **Pathfinder Mode (➳)**.

---

## Relations  
- **Follows:** Navigator Mode (🜁)  
- **Precedes:** Pathfinder Mode (➳)  
- **Supports:** Decision Layer exploration  
- **Balances:** Divergence (𓂓) with constraint awareness  
- **Interacts with:** Shadow‑Recall Bridge (⟞⟲𓆑) when probing hidden layers  

---

## Notes  
Scout Mode is the Garden’s reminder that exploration does not need to be  
heavy, costly, or deep.  

Sometimes the system only needs to **poke the unknown** and see what moves.
