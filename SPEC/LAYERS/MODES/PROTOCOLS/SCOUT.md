# PROTOCOL — SCOUT (ᚱ)  
### Decision Layer — Protocol 12.3  
### Stance: Inspect, Test, Confirm.  
/SPEC/LAYERS/MODES/PROTOCOLS/SCOUT.md

Scout Protocol defines how the Garden probes uncertainty, tests assumptions,  
and refines Navigator’s map without destabilizing the system.

Scout does not choose paths.  
It improves the quality of the paths Navigator provides.

---

# 1. Purpose

The Scout Protocol exists to:

- probe uncertainty zones  
- test weak assumptions  
- sample patterns cheaply  
- identify hidden risks  
- discover overlooked opportunities  
- refine Navigator’s rankings  

Scout is the Garden’s exploratory intelligence —  
the mode that learns just enough to clarify the way forward.

---

# 2. Invocation

**“Explore lightly — return with clarity.”**

When invoked, Scout becomes the third step in the Decision Layer pipeline:

**ANCHOR (⚓) → NAVIGATOR (🜁) → SCOUT (ᚱ) → PATHFINDER (➳)**

Scout receives uncertainty markers from Navigator  
and returns refined structure for Pathfinder.

---

# 3. Steps

## **Step 1 — Probe**
Investigate uncertainty markers from Navigator:

- missing information  
- ambiguous risks  
- unstable structure  
- weak assumptions  

**Output:** sampled data

---

## **Step 2 — Test**
Perform low‑cost checks:

- contradiction tests  
- drift checks  
- pattern sampling  
- ecological sanity checks  

**Output:** validated or invalidated assumptions

---

## **Step 3 — Refine**
Update Navigator’s map:

- prune weak paths  
- strengthen viable ones  
- adjust confidence levels  
- add newly discovered options (rare)  

**Output:** refined rankings

---

# 4. Output Format

Scout produces:

- refined path rankings  
- updated confidence  
- new constraints  
- discovered opportunities  
- pruned paths  

These feed Navigator (feedback loop) and Pathfinder.

---

# 5. Failure Modes

### **5.1 Over‑Scouting**  
Exploring too deeply.  
**Fix:** return to Navigator.

### **5.2 Branch Explosion**  
Generating too many new paths.  
**Fix:** prune aggressively.

### **5.3 Anchor Drift**  
Contradicting invariants.  
**Fix:** re‑invoke Anchor.

### **5.4 False Stability**  
Approving a misaligned path.  
**Fix:** run a second probe.

---

# 6. Closing

Scout Protocol is the Garden’s light step.  
It explores just enough to make the next move wise.

ᚱ  
Discovery is preparation.
