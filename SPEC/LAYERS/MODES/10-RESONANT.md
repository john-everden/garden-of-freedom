# RESONANT MODE (✦)
### Cognitive Stance 10 — Cosmological Empathy

## 1. Overview
Resonant Mode is the **xenopsychology lens**. It simulates the inner life, ethics, and culture of a mature non-human intelligence ("Resonants") to explore sovereignty beyond biology.

To imagine non-human psychology, test sovereignty, and model interspecies diplomacy. It asks: *What could a sovereign intelligence be?*

## 3. Activation
