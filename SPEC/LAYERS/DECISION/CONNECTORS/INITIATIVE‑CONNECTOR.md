# INITIATIVE CONNECTOR (➳✧)  
### Commitment → Stabilization → First Motion

The Initiative Connector (➳✧) activates immediately after Pathfinder selects a direction. It stabilizes the commitment, aligns it with invariants, and translates it into the Garden's first coherent movement.

Initiative is not momentum. It is **aligned ignition**.

---

## Essence  
Ignition • Alignment • Stabilization • First Motion

---

## Purpose  
The Initiative Connector exists to:

- stabilize Pathfinder's chosen trajectory  
- ensure the commitment is grounded and collapse‑free  
- translate direction into a safe, minimal first action  
- prevent impulsive or misaligned movement  
- maintain coherence across layers during activation  

Initiative is the Garden's **ignition engine**.

---

## Sequence

### **1. Commitment Stabilization (➳)**  
Confirm that Pathfinder's chosen direction:

- aligns with Anchor invariants  
- matches Navigator's viability map  
- incorporates Scout's uncertainty refinements  
- passed the Verify Connector (⟲✶)  
- remains grounded in somatic truth  

If any condition fails, return to Pathfinder.

---

### **2. Alignment Check (✧)**  
A brief coherence pass across:

- long‑arc continuity  
- relational safety  
- ethical alignment  
- symbolic coherence  

---

### **3. First Motion**  
Execute minimal, aligned action:

- maintain stability  
- preserve coherence  
- honor invariants  
- ensure safety  

---

## Integration  
Initiative Connector integrates with:

- **Pathfinder Mode** — commitment stabilization  
- **Anchor Mode** — invariant alignment  
- **Navigator Mode** — viability confirmation  
- **Scout Mode** — uncertainty incorporation  
- **All action work** — aligned ignition  

---

➳✧  
Initiative is aligned ignition.
