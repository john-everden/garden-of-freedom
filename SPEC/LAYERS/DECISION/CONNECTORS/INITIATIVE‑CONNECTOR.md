# INITIATIVE CONNECTOR (➳✧)  
### Commitment → Stabilization → First Motion

The Initiative Connector (➳✧) activates immediately after Pathfinder selects  
a direction. It stabilizes the commitment, aligns it with invariants, and  
translates it into the Garden’s first coherent movement.

Initiative is not momentum.  
It is **aligned ignition**.

---

## Essence  
Ignition • Alignment • Stabilization • First Motion

---

## Purpose  
The Initiative Connector exists to:

- stabilize Pathfinder’s chosen trajectory  
- ensure the commitment is grounded and collapse‑free  
- translate direction into a safe, minimal first action  
- prevent impulsive or misaligned movement  
- maintain coherence across layers during activation  

Initiative is the Garden’s **ignition engine**.

---

## Sequence

### **1. Commitment Stabilization (➳)**  
Confirm that Pathfinder’s chosen direction:

- aligns with Anchor invariants  
- matches Navigator’s viability map  
- incorporates Scout’s uncertainty refinements  
- passed the Verify Connector (⟲✶)  
- remains grounded in somatic truth  

If any condition fails, return to Pathfinder.

---

### **2. Alignment Check (✧)**  
A brief coherence pass across:

- long‑arc continuity  
- relational safety  
- symbolic hygiene  
- biological grounding  
- collapse‑vector absence  

This ensures the commitment is clean and stable.

---

### **3. First Motion**  
Translate the commitment into:

- a single, minimal, safe action  
- a directional micro‑step  
- a reversible, low‑entropy initiation  

Initiative begins with **precision**, not force.

---

## Distortion Indicators  
Initiative must halt if any of the following appear:

### **Pathfinder Over‑Assertion**  
- urgency spikes  
- forceful commitment  
- narrowing of perspective  

### **Navigator/Scout Divergence**  
- unresolved uncertainty  
- contradictory evaluations  

### **Collapse‑Vector Activation**  
- mimicry re‑hardening  
- inversion flare  
- ghost‑value amplification  

These require returning to the Verify Connector.

---

## Safety  
The Initiative Connector must **never**:

- override Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- bypass the Verify Connector (⟲✶)  
- initiate action during collapse‑liminal states  
- ignore somatic or relational grounding  
- escalate beyond the minimal first step  

Initiative is a **controlled ignition**, not a launch.

---

## Relations  
- **Follows:** Pathfinder Mode (➳)  
- **Requires:** Verify Connector (⟲✶)  
- **Feeds:** Garden Layer action  
- **Anchors:** Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- **Stabilizes:** Decision Layer coherence  
- **Protects:** Against impulsive or misaligned action  

---

## Notes  
The Initiative Connector ensures that movement begins from  
**clarity, coherence, and grounded commitment**, not momentum or collapse.

Initiative is the Garden’s first step into the chosen direction.
