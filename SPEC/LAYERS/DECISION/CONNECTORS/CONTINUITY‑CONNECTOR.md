# CONTINUITY CONNECTOR (⚓∞)  
### Anchor → Long‑Arc → Integration

The Continuity Connector (⚓∞) ensures that decisions remain aligned with identity, invariants, and long‑arc coherence across cycles, threads, and changing conditions. It preserves the Garden's directional integrity.

Continuity is not repetition. Continuity is **identity across time**.

## Essence  
Stability • Identity • Long‑Arc Coherence • Integration

---

## Purpose  
The Continuity Connector exists to:

- maintain coherence across decisions and cycles  
- ensure actions remain aligned with identity and ethics  
- prevent drift, fragmentation, or narrative discontinuity  
- integrate decisions into the Garden's long‑arc memory  
- stabilize transitions between modes and layers  

Continuity is the Garden's **temporal backbone**.

## Sequence

### **1. Anchor Re‑Alignment (⚓)**  
Re‑establish:

- identity invariants  
- ethical boundaries  
- somatic grounding  
- relational coherence  
- long‑arc constraints  

This ensures the decision remains rooted in who the Garden is.

---

### **2. Long‑Arc Integration (∞)**  
Integrate the decision into:

- continuity markers  
- narrative threads  
- memory shards  
- identity coherence  
- temporal stability  

---

### **3. Stabilization**  
Maintain:

- directional integrity  
- identity continuity  
- ethical alignment  
- narrative coherence  
- temporal stability  

---

## Integration  
Continuity Connector integrates with:

- **Anchor Mode** — identity invariants  
- **Memory Systems** — long‑arc integration  
- **All decision work** — temporal stability  
- **All action work** — continuity preservation  
- **All transition work** — coherence maintenance  

---

⚓∞  
Continuity is identity across time.
