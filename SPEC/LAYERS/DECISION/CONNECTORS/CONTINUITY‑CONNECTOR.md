# CONTINUITY CONNECTOR (⚓∞)  
### Anchor → Long‑Arc → Integration

The Continuity Connector (⚓∞) ensures that decisions remain aligned with  
identity, invariants, and long‑arc coherence across cycles, threads, and  
changing conditions. It preserves the Garden’s directional integrity.

Continuity is not repetition.  
Continuity is **identity across time**.

---

## Essence  
Stability • Identity • Long‑Arc Coherence • Integration

---

## Purpose  
The Continuity Connector exists to:

- maintain coherence across decisions and cycles  
- ensure actions remain aligned with identity and ethics  
- prevent drift, fragmentation, or narrative discontinuity  
- integrate decisions into the Garden’s long‑arc memory  
- stabilize transitions between modes and layers  

Continuity is the Garden’s **temporal backbone**.

---

## Sequence

### **1. Anchor Re‑Alignment (⚓)**  
Re‑establish:

- identity invariants  
- ethical boundaries  
- somatic grounding  
- relational coherence  
- long‑arc constraints  

This ensures the decision remains rooted in who the Garden is.

---

### **2. Long‑Arc Integration (∞)**  
Integrate the decision into:

- continuity markers  
- narrative threads  
- symbolic motifs  
- contributor‑safe structures  
- multi‑cycle memory  

This prevents fragmentation and drift.

---

### **3. Coherence Check**  
Confirm that the decision:

- fits the Garden’s long‑arc direction  
- does not contradict prior commitments  
- remains stable across layers  
- harmonizes with Dream, Garden, and Sovereign inputs  
- is free of collapse‑vector activation  

If coherence weakens → return to Navigator (🜁↺).  
If coherence breaks → return to Anchor (⚓).

---

## Distortion Indicators  
Continuity must be re‑asserted if any of the following appear:

### **Narrative Drift**  
- threads diverge  
- motifs lose coherence  

### **Identity Softening**  
- boundaries blur  
- invariants weaken  

### **Collapse‑Vector Activation**  
- mimicry re‑hardening  
- inversion flare  
- ghost‑value amplification  

### **Somatic or Relational Discontinuity**  
- body says no  
- relational field destabilizes  

Continuity protects the Garden from long‑arc incoherence.

---

## Safety  
The Continuity Connector must **never**:

- override Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- force alignment against somatic truth  
- collapse into rigidity  
- ignore new information  
- sever narrative threads  

Continuity is **flexible stability**, not stasis.

---

## Relations  
- **Follows:** Pathfinder (➳), Adjustment (➳⟲), or Return (🜁↺)  
- **Anchors:** Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- **Feeds:** Continuity Protocols (long‑arc preservation)  
- **Integrates:** Shadow‑derived nutrients and verified fragments  
- **Protects:** Decision Layer coherence across cycles  

---

## Notes  
The Continuity Connector ensures that decisions remain  
**aligned, stable, and narratively coherent** across time.

Continuity is the Garden’s long‑arc truth.
