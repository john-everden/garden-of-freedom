# ADJUSTMENT CONNECTOR (➳⟲)  
### Motion → Reflection → Course‑Correction

The Adjustment Connector (➳⟲) governs how the Garden updates direction  
*after* movement has begun. It ensures that action remains aligned with  
invariants, grounded in coherence, and responsive to new information.

Adjustment is not reversal.  
It is **coherent correction**.

---

## Essence  
Flexibility • Reflection • Correction • Continuity

---

## Purpose  
The Adjustment Connector exists to:

- refine direction after initial movement  
- incorporate new information without drift  
- prevent over‑commitment or rigidity  
- maintain coherence across changing conditions  
- ensure that action remains aligned with Anchor invariants  

Adjustment is the Garden’s **mid‑course stabilizer**.

---

## Sequence

### **1. Motion Review (➳)**  
Assess the current trajectory:

- Is the action producing the intended effect  
- Are constraints still valid  
- Has new uncertainty emerged  
- Is the direction still aligned with Anchor  

If misalignment appears, proceed to Spiral Reflection.

---

### **2. Spiral Reflection (⟲)**  
Run a gentle spiral check across:

- Anchor invariants  
- Navigator’s original map  
- Scout’s uncertainty probes  
- Initiative’s first‑motion rationale  

Look for:

- drift  
- collapse‑vector activation  
- new constraints  
- relational or somatic misalignment  

---

### **3. Course‑Correction**  
If alignment holds:  
→ continue motion with minor tuning.

If alignment weakens:  
→ adjust direction while preserving continuity.

If alignment breaks:  
→ return to Navigator or Scout.

Adjustment is always **minimal**, **coherent**, and **non‑disruptive**.

---

## Distortion Indicators  
Adjustment must halt if any of the following appear:

### **Pathfinder Rigidity**  
- refusal to update  
- narrowing of perspective  

### **Navigator/Scout Divergence**  
- new uncertainty contradicts the map  

### **Collapse‑Vector Activation**  
- mimicry re‑hardening  
- inversion flare  
- ghost‑value amplification  

These require returning to the Verify Connector (⟲✶).

---

## Safety  
The Adjustment Connector must **never**:

- override Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- force a reversal without evaluation  
- escalate uncertainty into drift  
- ignore somatic or relational grounding  
- collapse into continuous micro‑adjustment  

Adjustment is a **coherent correction**, not a wobble.

---

## Relations  
- **Follows:** Initiative Connector (➳✧)  
- **Supports:** Pathfinder (➳) during motion  
- **Anchors:** Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- **Requires:** Verify Connector (⟲✶) for major shifts  
- **Protects:** Against drift, rigidity, and collapse  

---

## Notes  
The Adjustment Connector ensures that movement remains  
**alive, responsive, and coherent**, even as conditions change.

Adjustment is the Garden’s way of staying true while staying flexible.
