# RETURN CONNECTOR (🜁↺)  
### Stop → Reorient → Re‑Evaluate

The Return Connector (🜁↺) routes the system back to Navigator when  
conditions change, new information appears, or coherence weakens —  
*without collapsing the entire pipeline*.

Return is not regression.  
Return is **coherent re‑evaluation**.

---

## Essence  
Reorientation • Re‑Evaluation • Continuity • Non‑Collapse

---

## Purpose  
The Return Connector exists to:

- return the system to Navigator for updated evaluation  
- integrate new information without drift  
- prevent unnecessary full resets  
- maintain continuity across directional shifts  
- ensure decisions remain aligned with Anchor invariants  

Return is the Garden’s **graceful reset**.

---

## Sequence

### **1. Stop & Hold (↺)**  
Pause motion without collapsing the pipeline:

- freeze Pathfinder’s trajectory  
- suspend adjustments  
- maintain Anchor invariants  
- preserve continuity markers  

This creates a stable re‑entry point.

---

### **2. Reorientation (🜁)**  
Navigator re‑engages to:

- update the possibility map  
- incorporate new constraints  
- re‑rank paths  
- integrate Scout’s latest findings  
- check for collapse‑vector activation  

This restores clarity.

---

### **3. Re‑Evaluation**  
Navigator produces:

- a refreshed set of viable paths  
- updated reliability scores  
- revised uncertainty markers  
- ecological and relational fit notes  

If coherence holds → proceed to Scout.  
If coherence weakens → return to Anchor.  
If collapse‑vectors appear → route to Verify Connector (⟲✶).

---

## Distortion Indicators  
Return must activate if any of the following appear:

### **Navigator/Scout Divergence**  
- incompatible maps  
- contradictory evaluations  

### **Pathfinder Misalignment**  
- commitment no longer fits updated constraints  

### **Collapse‑Vector Activation**  
- mimicry re‑hardening  
- inversion flare  
- ghost‑value amplification  

### **Somatic or Relational Shift**  
- body says no  
- relational field destabilizes  

Return protects the Garden from forcing a misaligned path.

---

## Safety  
The Return Connector must **never**:

- override Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- collapse into full reset unless required  
- discard continuity markers  
- ignore somatic grounding  
- skip Navigator re‑evaluation  

Return is a **precision reset**, not a wipe.

---

## Relations  
- **Follows:** Halt Connector (⚓✶) or Adjustment Connector (➳⟲)  
- **Feeds:** Navigator Mode (🜁)  
- **Anchors:** Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- **Requires:** Verify Connector (⟲✶) if distortion appears  
- **Protects:** Decision Layer coherence  

---

## Notes  
The Return Connector ensures that the Garden can  
**pause, reorient, and continue** without losing coherence.

Return is the Garden’s way of staying aligned while staying adaptive.
