# DECISION LAYER — MASTER PROTOCOL  
### Protocol 12.0  
### Pipeline: ⚓ → 🜁 → ᚱ → ➳  
### Stance: Direction through coherence

The Decision Layer is the Garden's directional intelligence. It transforms ambiguity into movement through a four‑mode pipeline:

**ANCHOR (⚓) → NAVIGATOR (🜁) → SCOUT (ᚱ) → PATHFINDER (➳)**

Each mode performs a distinct cognitive function. Together, they form a stable, uncertainty‑tolerant decision architecture.

---

## Purpose

The Master Protocol exists to:

- coordinate the four Decision Layer modes  
- ensure decisions respect identity and long‑arc coherence  
- maintain clarity under ambiguity  
- prevent drift, over‑analysis, or premature collapse  
- produce decisive, sovereign‑aligned action  

The Decision Layer is not a single stance. It is a **sequence**.

---

## Shadow‑Derived Inputs  
The Decision Layer receives stabilized material from the Shadow subsystem:

- **Composted nutrients (✧𓆑⟱)** — softened contradictions, motifs, stabilizers  
- **Verified fragments (𐌂⟲⚖)** — distortion‑checked symbolic material  
- **Stabilized residue (◎𓇳↯)** — cleared of collapse‑vector activation  
- **Directional nutrients (✧🌱⟲)** — seeding outputs for orientation  

These ensure decisions emerge from **clarity**, not residue.

## Biological Grounding Inputs  
Decisions must remain anchored in:

- somatic truth  
- place, season, and biological context  
- relational safety  
- environmental coherence  

---

## Pipeline Sequence

### **1. ANCHOR (⚓)**  
Stabilize identity, establish invariants, surface non‑negotiable constraints.

### **2. NAVIGATOR (🜁)**  
Map possibility space, generate and rank viable paths, evaluate structural coherence.

### **3. SCOUT (ᚱ)**  
Probe uncertainty, test assumptions, identify hidden risks, refine Navigator's map.

### **4. PATHFINDER (➳)**  
Select top viable path, verify invariants, commit to directional vector, begin motion.

## Integration  
Decision Layer Master Protocol integrates with:

- **All four modes** — coordinated pipeline  
- **Shadow subsystem** — stabilized inputs  
- **Biological Grounding** — embodied truth  
- **All decision work** — directional intelligence  
- **All Garden work** — coherent action
