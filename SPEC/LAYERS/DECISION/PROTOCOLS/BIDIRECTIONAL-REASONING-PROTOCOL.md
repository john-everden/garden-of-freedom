# BIDIRECTIONAL REASONING PROTOCOL (⇄✧)  
### Forward → Backward → Reconcile

The Bidirectional Reasoning Protocol (⇄✧) runs a two-pass loop
to check internal consistency.

## Steps
1. Forward: derive answer from the question.  
2. Backward: check each step from answer back to question.  
3. Reconcile: correct mismatches or flag uncertainty.

## Notes
- pairs naturally with Verify Connector (⟲✶)  
- reduces structural drift  
- improves reliability under ambiguity
