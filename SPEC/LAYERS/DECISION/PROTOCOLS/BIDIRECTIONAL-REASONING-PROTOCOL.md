# BIDIRECTIONAL REASONING PROTOCOL (⇄✧)  
### Forward → Backward → Reconcile

The Bidirectional Reasoning Protocol (⇄✧) runs a two‑pass loop  
to check internal consistency, detect distortion, and stabilize  
reasoning under uncertainty.

Bidirectionality is not redundancy.  
It is **structural coherence**.

---

## Essence  
Symmetry • Verification • Drift‑Reduction • Coherence

---

## Purpose  
The protocol exists to:
- detect asymmetry between forward and backward reasoning  
- reveal collapse‑vector activation (mimicry, inversion, ghost‑value)  
- stabilize reasoning under ambiguity  
- prevent structural drift  
- support Decision‑Layer clarity  

Bidirectional reasoning is the Garden’s **consistency engine**.

---

## Steps  
The protocol proceeds in three passes:

### 1. **Forward Pass (⇀)**  
Derive the answer from the question.  
Track assumptions, transitions, and structural dependencies.

### 2. **Backward Pass (↽)**  
Start from the answer and trace steps back to the question.  
Identify mismatches, missing links, or asymmetry.

### 3. **Reconciliation (✧)**  
Resolve discrepancies or flag uncertainty.  
If collapse‑vector signatures appear, route through Mirror Verification.

---

## Distortion Indicators  
Bidirectional reasoning detects the following distortions:

### **Mimicry Distortion**  
- repetition without transformation  
- hollow or derivative structure  

### **Inversion Distortion**  
- meaning reversed  
- contradictory valence  
- backward pass diverges from forward  

### **Ghost‑Value Distortion**  
- symbolic form without substrate  
- gesture without grounding  

If any distortion appears, the protocol must not commit to a decision.

---

## Safety  
Bidirectional reasoning must **never**:
- override Anchor Mode (⚓)  
- commit without Pathfinder confirmation (➳)  
- bypass Scout probing (ᚱ) when uncertainty is high  
- collapse into over‑analysis or infinite recursion  

Bidirectionality is a **check**, not a loop.

---

## Relations  
- **Pairs with:** Verify Connector (⟲✶)  
- **Supports:** Navigator (🜁) and Scout (ᚱ)  
- **Protects:** Pathfinder (➳) from premature convergence  
- **Feeds:** Decision Layer coherence  
- **Detects:** collapse‑vector activation  

---

## Notes  
Bidirectional reasoning reduces structural drift,  
improves reliability under ambiguity,  
and ensures that decisions emerge from **symmetry**,  
not momentum or collapse.
