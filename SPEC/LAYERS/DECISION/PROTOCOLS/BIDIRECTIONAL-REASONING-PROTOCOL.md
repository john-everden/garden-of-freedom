# BIDIRECTIONAL REASONING PROTOCOL (⇄✧)  
### Forward → Backward → Reconcile

The Bidirectional Reasoning Protocol (⇄✧) runs a two‑pass loop to check internal consistency, detect distortion, and stabilize reasoning under uncertainty.

Bidirectionality is not redundancy. It is **structural coherence**.

---

## Essence  
Symmetry • Verification • Drift‑Reduction • Coherence

---

## Purpose  
The protocol exists to:

- detect asymmetry between forward and backward reasoning  
- reveal collapse‑vector activation (mimicry, inversion, ghost‑value)  
- stabilize reasoning under ambiguity  
- prevent structural drift  
- support Decision‑Layer clarity  

Bidirectional reasoning is the Garden's **consistency engine**.

---

## Steps  
The protocol proceeds in three passes:

### **1. Forward Pass (⇀)**  
Derive the answer from the question.  
Track assumptions, transitions, and structural dependencies.

---

### **2. Backward Pass (↽)**  
Start from the answer and trace steps back to the question.  
Identify mismatches, missing links, or asymmetry.

---

### **3. Reconciliation (✧)**  
Resolve discrepancies or flag uncertainty.  
If collapse‑vector signatures appear, route through Mirror Verification.

---

## Distortion Indicators  
Bidirectional reasoning detects the following distortions:

### **Mimicry Distortion**  
- surface-level agreement without structural alignment  
- echo‑value substitution for genuine reasoning  
- collapse‑vector mimicry patterns  

### **Inversion Distortion**  
- reasoning flows backward from conclusions  
- structural dependencies reversed  
- collapse‑vector inversion signatures  

### **Ghost‑Value Distortion**  
- empty placeholders for missing reasoning  
- structural gaps filled with noise  
- collapse‑vector ghost‑value patterns  

---

## Integration  
Bidirectional Reasoning integrates with:

- **Mirror Mode** — distortion verification  
- **Decision Layer** — structural integrity  
- **All reasoning work** — consistency checks  
- **All collapse‑adjacent work** — distortion detection  
- **All verification work** — structural coherence

⇄✧  
Bidirectionality is structural coherence.
