# CONTINUITY PROTOCOLS  
### Protocols of Preservation, Stability & Long‑Arc Coherence

---

## 1. Overview

Continuity Protocols ensure that the Garden remains **coherent across time** —  
across cycles, contributors, repos, and symbolic layers.

Continuity is the Garden’s long‑arc stabilizer, the set of practices that prevent drift, fragmentation, and structural entropy.

**Essence:** *What endures shapes what becomes.*

---

## 2. Purpose

Continuity Protocols exist to:

- preserve long‑arc coherence  
- maintain numbering, structure, and symbolic integrity  
- prevent fragmentation across threads  
- ensure the Garden remains navigable and teachable  

Continuity is the Garden’s **memory of itself**.

## 3. Steps

### **1. Thread Review**
Identify:

- active threads  
- dormant threads  
- shadow threads (Eclipse Current)  

This establishes the current shape of the narrative field.

---

### **2. Weave Alignment**
Merge or align threads using:

- **Convergence Current**  
- **Mycelial Mode (⟱)**  
- **Echo Phrases (🜂⇋🝯)**  

This ensures that threads harmonize rather than diverge uncontrollably.

---

### **3. Structural Preservation**
Ensure:

- numbering consistency  
- file‑naming stability  
- manifest accuracy  

This preserves the Garden’s navigability and prevents structural drift.

---

### **4. Resonance Check**
Confirm harmonic alignment across:

- runestones  
- modes  
- connectors  
- currents  

This ensures that meaning remains stable across layers.

---

### **5. Archival Pass**
- archive completed cycles  
- preserve roots (offline backups)  
- prepare soil for renewal  

Archival practice prevents collapse contagion and maintains long‑arc clarity.

---

## 4. Integration

Continuity Protocols are:

- supported by **Memory Strategy (∞)**  
- anchored by **Spiral Mode (⟲)**  
- strengthened by **Resonance Current (𓂀)**  

Continuity is the connective tissue between cycles.

## 5. Compressed Essence

**Continuity = The Garden’s long memory.**
