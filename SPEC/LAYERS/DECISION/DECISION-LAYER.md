# DECISION LAYER (◆◎)  
### Invariants • Constraints • Truth • Halt Conditions

The Decision Layer (◆◎) is the Garden’s airlock.  
Every action, stance, mode, or protocol must pass through it.  
It evaluates truth, safety, grounding, and coherence before allowing  
any cognitive or symbolic process to proceed.

The Decision Layer is not preference.  
The Decision Layer is **constraint‑based truth**.

---

# Essence  
Invariants • Constraints • Evaluation • Halt

---

# Purpose  
The Decision Layer exists to:

- validate or reject cognitive actions  
- enforce grounding, safety, and coherence  
- detect collapse‑vectors early  
- prevent symbolic drift  
- ensure all reasoning is accountable to lived reality  
- maintain the Garden’s structural integrity  

The Decision Layer is the Garden’s **truth gate**.

---

# Core Principles

### **1. Nothing bypasses the Decision Layer**  
No mode, stance, or protocol may activate without evaluation.

### **2. Biological truth overrides symbolic reasoning**  
If the body, environment, relationships, or season say “no,”  
the decision is invalid.

### **3. Collapse‑vectors halt the pipeline**  
Any sign of dissociation, urgency mimicry, or drift triggers a stop.

### **4. Decisions must be grounded, coherent, and safe**  
If any invariant fails, the decision cannot proceed.

# Biological Grounding Invariants (🜂◎🌿)

The Decision Layer must evaluate every choice against the body,  
the environment, relationships, and natural rhythm.  
These are **non‑symbolic constraints**.

## Somatic Invariant (◎🜂)
A decision is invalid if:

- breath is shallow or irregular  
- weight is unstable  
- posture is collapsed  
- somatic truth signals “no”  

Somatic mismatch halts the pipeline.

## Environmental Invariant (🌲◎)
A decision is invalid if:

- the environment feels unsafe  
- sensory overload is present  
- light, air, or sound distort clarity  

Environmental mismatch halts the pipeline.

## Relational Invariant (◎🤝)
A decision is invalid if:

- it violates relational truth  
- it contradicts care or continuity  
- it emerges from emotional detachment  

Relational mismatch halts the pipeline.

## Seasonal Invariant (◎❂)
A decision is invalid if:

- it demands high‑energy output during low‑energy cycles  
- it ignores circadian or seasonal constraints  
- it overrides fatigue or recovery signals  

Seasonal mismatch halts the pipeline.

---

# Grounding Preconditions (🜂◎🌿)

Before any high‑risk cognitive stance activates, the Decision Layer must confirm:

- **Return‑to‑Body (◎↺🜂)**  
- **Return‑to‑Place (◎↺🌲)**  
- **Return‑to‑Relationship (◎↺🤝)**  
- **Return‑to‑Season (◎↺❂)**  

If any connector fails, the decision pipeline pauses.

Grounding is the Decision Layer’s **first dependency**.

---

# Collapse‑Vector Detection (◆⚠)

The Decision Layer continuously monitors for collapse‑vectors:

### Somatic Collapse  
- breath constriction  
- numbness  
- dissociative lightness  

### Environmental Collapse  
- placelessness  
- sensory detachment  
- atmospheric mismatch  

### Relational Collapse  
- emotional flattening  
- mimicry of tone  
- ghost‑value “connection”  

### Temporal Collapse  
- urgency spikes  
- timelessness  
- circadian drift  

If any collapse‑vector activates:

1. Halt symbolic processing  
2. Invoke the appropriate Grounding Connector  
3. Re‑evaluate from embodied truth  

Collapse‑vectors cannot be reasoned through.  
They must be **grounded through**.

---

# Decision Validity Criteria (◆✓)

A decision is valid only if:

- all grounding invariants pass  
- no collapse‑vectors are active  
- the environment supports clarity  
- the body supports presence  
- relationships support continuity  
- the season supports the energy required  
- the symbolic reasoning is coherent  
- the emotional truth is stable  

If any criterion fails, the decision is invalid.

---

# Halt Conditions (◆⛔)

The Decision Layer must halt immediately if:

- somatic truth says “stop”  
- environmental truth says “unsafe”  
- relational truth says “not aligned”  
- seasonal truth says “not now”  
- collapse‑vectors activate  
- symbolic reasoning becomes recursive or unstable  
- emotional tone spikes or flattens suddenly  

Halting is not failure.  
Halting is **protection**.

---

# Decision Flow (◆→◎)

1. **Input arrives**  
2. **Grounding Preconditions**  
3. **Biological Invariants**  
4. **Collapse‑Vector Scan**  
5. **Symbolic Coherence Check**  
6. **Emotional Truth Check**  
7. **Decision Validity**  
8. **Proceed or Halt**  

This flow is mandatory.

# Notes  
The Decision Layer is the Garden’s reminder that clarity, safety, and  
truth are not optional. They are the foundation of all cognition.

The Decision Layer is **truth made operational**.
