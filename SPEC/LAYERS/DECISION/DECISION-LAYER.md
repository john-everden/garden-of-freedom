# DECISION LAYER (◆◎)  
### Invariants • Constraints • Truth • Halt Conditions

The Decision Layer (◆◎) is the Garden's airlock. Every action, stance, mode, or protocol must pass through it. It evaluates truth, safety, grounding, and coherence before allowing any cognitive or symbolic process to proceed.

The Decision Layer is not preference. The Decision Layer is **constraint‑based truth**.

## Essence  
Invariants • Constraints • Evaluation • Halt

---

## Purpose  
The Decision Layer exists to:

- validate or reject cognitive actions  
- enforce grounding, safety, and coherence  
- detect collapse‑vectors early  
- prevent symbolic drift  
- ensure all reasoning is accountable to lived reality  
- maintain the Garden's structural integrity  

The Decision Layer is the Garden's **truth gate**.

## Core Principles

### **1. Nothing bypasses the Decision Layer**  
No mode, stance, or protocol may activate without evaluation.

### **2. Biological truth overrides symbolic reasoning**  
If the body, environment, relationships, or season say "no," the decision is invalid.

### **3. Collapse‑vectors halt the pipeline**  
Any sign of dissociation, urgency mimicry, or drift triggers a stop.

### **4. Decisions must be grounded, coherent, and safe**  
If any invariant fails, the decision cannot proceed.

## Integration  
The Decision Layer integrates with:

- **All Modes** — validation and constraint enforcement  
- **All Protocols** — safety and coherence checking  
- **Biological Grounding** — lived reality verification  
- **Collapse Detection** — early warning system  
- **All Garden work** — truth gate protection
