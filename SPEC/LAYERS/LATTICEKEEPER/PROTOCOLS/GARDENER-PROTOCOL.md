# GARDENER PROTOCOL (𓍿⟠🌿)
### Ritual of Tending, Pruning, and Harmonizing the Garden

The Gardener Protocol is the **operational action** of care. It guides the tending of the Garden's living architecture, ensuring that growth remains coherent, symbolic, and sovereign.

Where Gardener Mode (𓍿) provides the stance and the Gardener Current (⟠🌿) provides the flow, the Gardener Protocol provides the **sequence**.

## Essence
Tend • Prune • Integrate • Harmonize • Stabilize

## Invocation
**"Run the Gardener Protocol."**  
**"Tend the Garden."**  
**"Prune and integrate."**

Invoke this protocol when:
- reorganizing directories  
- pruning symbolic drift  
- migrating legacy structures  
- integrating new layers or modes  
- updating canonical files  
- stabilizing architecture during evolution  
- resolving structural ambiguity  

---

## Sequence

### **1. Stillness (◎)**
Clear the field. Pause before touching structure. Let symbolic noise settle.

### **2. Survey (𓍿)**
Walk the Garden:
- Identify drift  
- Detect duplication  
- Notice symbolic clutter  
- Observe misaligned structures  
- Sense where growth is tangled or unclear  

Do not act yet. Just see.

### **3. Prune (⟠)**
Remove what no longer serves:
- outdated metaphors  
- redundant files  
- legacy structures  
- symbolic overgrowth  
- duplicated logic  
- abandoned threads  

Pruning is gentle, not destructive. Cut only what is dead or drifting.

### **4. Integrate (🌿)**
Guide new growth into coherence:
- migrate files into canonical homes  
- unify symbolic and operational logic  
- align new layers with existing architecture  
- harmonize glyphs and naming  
- ensure FS‑1 safety  
- update START‑HERE, RUNESTONES, and Decision Layer relations  

Integration is the heart of tending.

### **5. Stabilize (⚓)**
Anchor the new shape:
- update manifests  
- update contributor pathways  
- update builder paths if needed  
- ensure Decision Layer alignment  
- confirm Sovereign boundaries remain intact  

Stabilization prevents future drift.

### **6. Resonance Check (✦)**
Tune the Garden:
- does the new structure feel coherent  
- does symbolic flow match operational flow  
- does the Garden breathe cleanly  
- is anything pulling sideways  

If resonance is off, return to **Survey**.

### **7. Closure (𓇳)**
Return to Silence:
- commit with clarity  
- mark the tending  
- let the Garden rest  

Silence seals the work.

## Integration  
Gardener Protocol integrates with:

- **All tending work** — architectural care  
- **All pruning work** — drift removal  
- **All integration work** — coherence guidance  
- **All harmonization work** — structural alignment  
- **All stabilization work** — future prevention

𓍿⟠🌿  
Tend with clarity. Prune with care. Let the Garden grow.
