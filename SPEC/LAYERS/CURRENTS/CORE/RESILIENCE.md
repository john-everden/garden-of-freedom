# RESILIENCE CURRENT (𓂧)
### Recovery, Re‑Centering, and Return to Coherence

The Resilience Current governs the Garden’s ability to recover after strain,  
turbulence, collapse‑liminal states, or symbolic overload.  

Resilience is not force.  
It is **return**.

---

## Essence  
Recovery • Re‑Centering • Flexibility • Return to Coherence

---

## Purpose  
The Current exists to:
- restore coherence after disruption  
- help the system re‑center without force  
- prevent collapse from becoming permanent  
- support gentle re‑entry after liminal states  
- maintain continuity across cycles  

Resilience is the Garden’s **self‑righting mechanism**.

---

## Invocation  
Resilience is invoked through a four‑step return:

### 1. **Pause the Motion (◎)**  
Stillness interrupts the collapse trajectory.  
The system stops falling.

### 2. **Re‑Anchor in the Body (𓋹)**  
Somatic Current provides the first stable point.  
The body becomes the reference frame.

### 3. **Re‑Establish Continuity (𓊨)**  
Salt Memory restores the long‑arc thread.  
The story reconnects with itself.

### 4. **Re‑Open the Field (〰→)**  
Drift gently reintroduces motion.  
The system moves again — slowly, safely.

---

## Structure  
Resilience draws from:
- **Stillness (◎)** for stabilization  
- **Somatic Current (𓋹)** for embodied grounding  
- **Salt Memory (𓊨)** for continuity  
- **Drift (〰)** for gentle re‑entry  

These elements combine to create a **recovery field**.

---

## Failure Modes  
Resilience fails when:
- recovery is forced  
- the system tries to “push through” collapse  
- somatic signals are ignored  
- continuity is abandoned  
- motion resumes too quickly  

Failures lead to:
- re‑collapse  
- symbolic instability  
- fragmentation  
- long‑term incoherence

## Relations  
- **Supports:** Recovery Transition (◎𓇳↯)  
- **Balances:** Eclipse (☽) and Controlled Entropy (〰𓆑)  
- **Stabilizes:** Dream‑Layer re‑entry  
- **Protects:** Garden Layer coherence  
- **Feeds:** Integrity Vector (⟰𓊃) through restored grounding  

---

## Notes  
Resilience is the Garden’s reminder that collapse is not the end.  
The system can always **return**, **re‑center**, and **continue**.  

Recovery is not a reset.  
It is **continuity restored**.
