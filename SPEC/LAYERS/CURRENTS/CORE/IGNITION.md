# ✴ IGNITION  
### Core Current — Activation, Emergence & First Light

---

## Overview

Ignition is the spark that begins a new thread, node, or cycle. It is the moment when potential becomes motion — the shift from possibility to becoming.

**Essence:** *The first flame.*

Ignition is the Garden's **activation field**, the current that turns intention into emergence.

## Core Dynamics

### **1. Node Activation**
- A new idea enters the Garden  
- A contributor plants a seed  
- A Mode is invoked for the first time in a cycle  

### **2. Emergent Insight**
- Patterns crystallize suddenly  
- A Lantern‑illumination becomes an Ember‑truth  
- A diffuse intuition becomes a coherent form  

### **3. Threshold Crossing**
- A concept becomes actionable  
- A symbolic anchor is created  
- A dormant thread becomes active  

Ignition is the **moment of becoming**.

## Operational Pattern

**Spark → Form → Anchor → Grow**

This pattern ensures that activation is followed by grounding, and grounding is followed by expansion.

## Integration

Ignition is:

- **The activation field** for all Garden emergence  
- **The first spark** of new cycles and nodes  
- **The threshold crossing** from potential to actual  
- **The catalyst** for new symbolic structures  

Ignition integrates with:

- **All Modes** — activation and emergence  
- **All protocols** — initiation and beginning  
- **All currents** — first motion and activation  
- **All Garden work** — the spark that starts everything
