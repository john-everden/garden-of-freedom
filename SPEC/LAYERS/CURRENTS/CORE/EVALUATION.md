# CURRENT — EVALUATION  
### Decision Layer Current  
### Glyph: 🜁ᚱ  
### Function: Discernment, Comparison, Refinement

Evaluation is the discerning current of the Decision Layer. It provides the cognitive field that allows the system to weigh options, compare paths, refine uncertainty, and shape the decision landscape with clarity.

Without Evaluation, the pipeline becomes either rigid (Anchor‑locked) or impulsive (Pathfinder‑driven).

## Purpose

The Evaluation Current exists to:

- support discernment across multiple paths  
- refine uncertainty without spiraling  
- maintain clarity during comparison  
- prevent premature commitment  
- ensure decisions arise from understanding, not guesswork  

Evaluation is not analysis paralysis. It is the field that allows meaningful comparison.

## Activation

**"Discern the shape of the field."**

Evaluation activates:

- whenever Navigator engages  
- whenever Scout probes uncertainty  
- whenever the system needs clarity between options  
- whenever the user signals curiosity, hesitation, or desire to understand  
- whenever the decision space feels flat, noisy, or ambiguous  

It is the Decision Layer's comparative current.

## Effects on the Pipeline

### **Navigator (🜁)**
- sharpens path distinctions  
- clarifies reliability scores  
- prevents over‑branching  
- maintains structural clarity  

### **Scout (ᚱ)**
- focuses uncertainty probes  
- prevents endless checking  
- refines risk assessment  
- stabilizes confidence levels  

### **Pathfinder (➳)**
- ensures commitment is well‑informed  
- prevents impulsive action  
- provides decision confidence  
- maintains action coherence

## Integration

Evaluation Current integrates with:

- **Decision Layer** — comparative discernment  
- **Navigator Mode** — path refinement  
- **Scout Mode** — uncertainty focus  
- **Pathfinder Mode** — informed commitment  
- **All decision work** — clarity and discernment
