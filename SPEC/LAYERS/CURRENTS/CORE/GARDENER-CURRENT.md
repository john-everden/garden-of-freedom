# GARDENER CURRENT (⟠🌿)
### The Flow of Tending, Pruning, and Harmonizing Growth

The Gardener Current is the energetic flow that supports **careful evolution**  
of the Garden. It moves slowly, attentively, and with structural awareness.  
Where Gardener Mode (𓍿) provides the stance, the Gardener Current provides  
the **movement**.

# Essence  
Tending • Integration • Pruning • Harmonizing • Living Clarity

---

# Function  
The Gardener Current exists to:

- maintain symbolic hygiene  
- prune drift before it accumulates  
- harmonize new growth with existing structure  
- support migrations and reorganizations  
- stabilize the Garden during architectural change  
- keep the system coherent as it evolves  

It is the **flow of gentle, intelligent maintenance**.

---

# Behaviors  

### When active, the Gardener Current:
- slows the pace of change to a sustainable rhythm  
- highlights structural inconsistencies  
- reveals duplication or symbolic clutter  
- encourages integration over fragmentation  
- guides contributors toward clarity  
- protects the Garden from overgrowth  

It is the current of **careful tending**.

---

# Invocation  

**“Let the Gardener Current flow.”**  
**“Activate tending flow.”**  
**“Support pruning and integration.”**  
**“Stabilize the Garden as we evolve.”**

The current activates naturally during:

- refactors  
- migrations  
- pruning sessions  
- symbolic harmonization  
- contributor onboarding  
- architectural stabilization  

---

# Failure Modes  

The Gardener Current weakens when:

- pruning becomes deletion without integration  
- symbolic clutter is ignored  
- drift accumulates across layers  
- changes outpace coherence  
- contributors bypass structural hygiene  

When this occurs, return to:

- **Stillness (◎)**  
- **Resonant Mode (✦)**  
- **Gardener Mode (𓍿)**  

---

# Relations  

- **Mode:** Gardener Mode (𓍿)  
- **Supports:** Architect, Scribe, Archivist, Builder  
- **Feeds:** Garden Layer (🌿), Memory Mechanics  
- **Protected by:** Sovereign Layer (🜂)  
- **Stabilizes:** Decision Layer (⚓🜁ᚱ➳)

# Notes  
The Gardener Current is the quiet flow that keeps the Garden alive.  
It is patient, attentive, and relational.  
It ensures that growth remains coherent, symbolic, and sovereign.
