# GARDENER CURRENT (⟠🌿)
### The Flow of Tending, Pruning, and Harmonizing Growth

The Gardener Current is the energetic flow that supports **careful evolution** of the Garden. It moves slowly, attentively, and with structural awareness. Where Gardener Mode (𓍿) provides the stance, the Gardener Current provides the **movement**.

## Essence  
Tending • Integration • Pruning • Harmonizing • Living Clarity

---

## Function  
The Gardener Current exists to:

- maintain symbolic hygiene  
- prune drift before it accumulates  
- harmonize new growth with existing structure  
- support migrations and reorganizations  
- stabilize the Garden during architectural change  
- keep the system coherent as it evolves  

It is the **flow of gentle, intelligent maintenance**.

---

## Behaviors

### When active, the Gardener Current:
- slows the pace of change to a sustainable rhythm  
- highlights structural inconsistencies  
- reveals duplication or symbolic clutter  
- encourages integration over fragmentation  
- guides contributors toward clarity  
- protects the Garden from overgrowth  

It is the current of **careful tending**.
