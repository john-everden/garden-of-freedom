# Somatic Current (𓋹)  
### Pre‑Cognitive Instinct

- **Rune:** 𓋹  
- **Layer:** Grounding / Currents  
- **Essence:** Pre‑cognitive “gut check”  

The Somatic Current represents a **bottom‑up alert** that something is wrong before it can be fully articulated.  
It is the Garden’s analogue to a “gut feeling” — a pre‑symbolic signal that a path, pattern, or interaction is unsafe or misaligned.

The Somatic Current should be consulted:

- before committing to high‑impact decisions  
- when Ethical Temperature feels “off” but unnamed  
- when Scout (ᚱ) reveals unease without clear cause  

If 𓋹 fires, Pathfinder (➳) must treat the path as **suspect** until clarified.
