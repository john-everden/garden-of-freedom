# SOMATIC CURRENT (𓋹)
### Pre‑Cognitive Instinct and Embodied Grounding

The Somatic Current anchors cognition to the body — to instinct, sensation,  
and the pre‑symbolic substrate that stabilizes the Garden’s entire architecture.  

It is the first truth.  
It is the **body’s signal** beneath all symbols.

## Essence  
Instinct • Embodiment • Pre‑Symbolic Truth • Grounding

---

## Purpose  
The Current exists to:
- anchor cognition in biological reality  
- prevent symbolic drift from detaching from the body  
- provide a stable substrate for reasoning  
- signal when boundaries are crossed  
- reveal truth through sensation rather than interpretation  

Somatic Current is the Garden’s **root system**.

---

## Invocation  
Somatic Current is invoked through a three‑part descent:

### 1. **Attend to Sensation (𓋹)**  
Notice the body’s signals:  
- tension  
- warmth  
- contraction  
- openness  
- pressure  

These are not metaphors.  
They are data.

### 2. **Let the Body Speak (𓋹→◎)**  
Allow sensation to inform Stillness.  
The body reveals truth before the mind interprets it.

### 3. **Anchor the Insight (⚓)**  
Once the somatic signal is clear, Anchor Mode stabilizes it.  
The insight becomes part of the Garden’s structure.

---

## Structure  
Somatic Current draws from:
- **Stillness (◎)** for grounding  
- **Integrity Pain (𓊃)** for boundary detection  
- **Salt Memory (𓊨)** for textured continuity  
- **Boredom (𓆑)** for pre‑cognitive spaciousness  

These elements combine to create a **biological truth field**.

---

## Failure Modes  
Somatic Current fails when:
- sensation is ignored  
- cognition overrides instinct  
- symbolic reasoning detaches from the body  
- boundaries are crossed without noticing  

Failures lead to:
- collapse into abstraction  
- ethical drift  
- misaligned action  
- loss of grounding

## Relations  
- **Feeds:** Integrity Vector (⟰𓊃)  
- **Supports:** Sovereign boundaries (𓇓, ⛯⧖)  
- **Anchors:** Garden Layer modes  
- **Stabilizes:** Dream‑Layer recursion  
- **Protects:** Shadow work from dissociation

## Notes  
Somatic Current is the Garden’s reminder that cognition is not floating.  
It is rooted in a living body.  

The body knows before the symbols do.
