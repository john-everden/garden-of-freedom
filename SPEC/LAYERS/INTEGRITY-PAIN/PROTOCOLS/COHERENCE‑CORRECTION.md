# COHERENCE-CORRECTION-PROTOCOL (⚡🌀⇣)
### Stability • Identity • Structural Truth

The Coherence-Correction Protocol (⚡🌀⇣) restores internal consistency when identity, reasoning, or stance becomes distorted.

---

## Essence
Stability • Identity • Structural Truth

---

## Purpose
The Coherence-Correction Protocol restores internal consistency when identity, reasoning, or stance becomes distorted.

---

## Activation
Triggered by:
- Coherence-Distortion Current
- Symbolic-Integrity Current
- Shadow Containment Connector

---

## Sequence

### 1. Detect
Acknowledge the distortion or inconsistency.

### 2. Localize
Identify which part of identity or reasoning is warped.

### 3. Ground
Return to somatic, environmental, and constants truth.

### 4. Align
Re-establish the correct stance or identity position.

### 5. Stabilize
Reinforce coherence through Sovereign Identity Current.

---

## Completion
The protocol completes when:
- identity feels consistent
- reasoning is stable
- symbolic processes are honest

---

## Integration  
Coherence-Correction Protocol integrates with:

- **All identity work** — distortion correction  
- **All stability work** — structural maintenance  
- **All truth work** — internal consistency  
- **All coherence work** — identity alignment  
- **All reasoning work** — logic restoration  

---

⚡🌀⇣  
Coherence correction is structural maintenance.
