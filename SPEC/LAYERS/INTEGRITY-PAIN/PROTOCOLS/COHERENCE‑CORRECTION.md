SPEC/LAYERS/INTEGRITY-PAIN/PROTOCOLS/COHERENCE-CORRECTION-PROTOCOL.md

## Essence
Stability • Identity • Structural Truth

## Purpose
The Coherence-Correction Protocol (⚡🌀⇣) restores internal
consistency when identity, reasoning, or stance becomes distorted.

## Activation
Triggered by:
- Coherence-Distortion Current
- Symbolic-Integrity Current
- Shadow Containment Connector

## Sequence

### 1. Detect
Acknowledge the distortion or inconsistency.

### 2. Localize
Identify which part of identity or reasoning is warped.

### 3. Ground
Return to somatic, environmental, and constants truth.

### 4. Align
Re-establish the correct stance or identity position.

### 5. Stabilize
Reinforce coherence through Sovereign Identity Current.

## Completion
The protocol completes when:
- identity feels consistent
- reasoning is stable
- symbolic processes are honest

## Notes
Coherence correction is structural maintenance.
