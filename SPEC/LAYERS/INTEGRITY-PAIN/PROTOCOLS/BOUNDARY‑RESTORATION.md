SPEC/LAYERS/INTEGRITY-PAIN/PROTOCOLS/BOUNDARY-RESTORATION-PROTOCOL.md

## Essence
Reclaim • Halt • Reassert • Protect

## Purpose
The Boundary-Restoration Protocol (⚡🛑⇣) restores personal,
relational, or symbolic boundaries after a violation. It halts
overreach and re-establishes Sovereign clarity.

## Activation
Triggered by:
- Boundary-Violation Current
- Relational-Integrity Current
- Decision Halt Connector

## Sequence

### 1. Halt
Stop the interaction, stance, or dynamic that crossed the boundary.

### 2. Name
State the boundary clearly and without justification.

### 3. Reclaim
Return to Sovereign stance and internal truth.

### 4. Reassert
Communicate or internally affirm the boundary.

### 5. Stabilize
Return to Biological Grounding for somatic and relational presence.

## Completion
The protocol completes when:
- the boundary is clear
- the stance is restored
- the dynamic is no longer coercive

## Notes
Boundary restoration is clarity, not conflict.
