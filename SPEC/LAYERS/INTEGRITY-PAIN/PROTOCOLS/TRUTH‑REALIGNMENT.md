## Essence
Honesty • Correction • Alignment

## Purpose
The Truth-Realignment Protocol (⚡📉⇣) restores alignment between
action, stance, and internal truth. It prevents self-betrayal and
supports coherent decision-making.

## Activation
Triggered by:
- Truth-Misalignment Current
- Coherence-Distortion Current
- Decision Verification Connector

## Sequence

### 1. Pause
Stop the action or decision that contradicts truth.

### 2. Identify
Name the misalignment without judgment.

### 3. Clarify
Return to the internal truth that was overridden.

### 4. Correct
Adjust the action, stance, or decision to match truth.

### 5. Anchor
Reinforce alignment through Biological Grounding.

## Completion
The protocol completes when:
- truth is clear
- action matches stance
- coherence is restored

## Notes
Truth realignment is a return, not a reversal.
