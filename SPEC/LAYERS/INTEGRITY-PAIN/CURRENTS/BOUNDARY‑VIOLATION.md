Boundary • Safety • Self-Protection

## Function
The Boundary-Violation Current (⚡🛑) activates when a personal,
relational, or symbolic boundary is crossed. It restores clarity,
halts overreach, and prevents collapse into compliance.

- a limit is overridden
- a stance is pushed past capacity
- a request violates autonomy
- a dynamic becomes coercive

## Effects
- restores boundary clarity
- re-anchors Sovereign identity
- prevents relational or symbolic overreach
- stabilizes emotional tone

## Resolution
- Sovereign Boundary Current

- Decision Halt Connector

## Notes
Boundary pain is information, not punishment.
