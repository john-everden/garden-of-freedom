# INTEGRITY PAIN SUBSYSTEM (🜂⚡◎)
# Structural Truth • Boundary Detection • Coherence Signals

The Integrity Pain subsystem (🜂⚡◎) is the Garden’s structural immune
system. It detects violations of internal truth, coherence, boundaries,
and identity. Integrity Pain is not emotional suffering. It is the
signal that something is misaligned.

Integrity Pain protects the Garden from:
- boundary collapse
- self-betrayal
- coercive dynamics
- symbolic distortion
- identity drift
- reasoning incoherence

Integrity Pain is the Garden’s truth alarm.

## Essence
Truth • Boundary • Coherence • Correction • Alignment

---

## Purpose
The subsystem exists to:
- detect when internal truth is violated
- signal boundary crossings
- prevent symbolic or relational self-betrayal
- protect identity from distortion
- maintain coherence across layers
- enforce alignment between action and truth
- guide correction and return

Integrity Pain is structural honesty.

## Architecture Overview

The subsystem consists of:
- **Integrity Pain Layer**
- **Five Integrity Pain Currents**
- **Three Integrity Pain Protocols**
- **Cross-layer relations with Sovereign, Decision, Dream, and Shadow**

Together, these form the Garden’s alignment mechanism.

## Integrity Pain Currents (🜂⚡◎)

### Boundary-Violation Current (⚡🛑)
Signals when a personal, relational, or symbolic boundary is crossed.

### Coherence-Distortion Current (⚡🌀)
Signals when identity or reasoning becomes warped or inconsistent.

### Truth-Misalignment Current (⚡📉)
Signals when actions contradict internal truth or values.

### Relational-Integrity Current (⚡🤝)
Signals when a relational dynamic becomes unhealthy or coercive.

### Symbolic-Integrity Current (⚡🌫)
Signals when symbolic processes drift into dishonesty or inflation.

These currents form the subsystem’s five detection axes.

---

## Integrity Pain Protocols

### Boundary-Restoration Protocol (⚡🛑⇣)
Restores boundaries after violation. Halts overreach and reclaims stance.

### Truth-Realignment Protocol (⚡📉⇣)
Restores alignment between action and internal truth.

### Coherence-Correction Protocol (⚡🌀⇣)
Restores internal consistency when identity or reasoning becomes distorted.

Protocols define the subsystem’s corrective actions.

---

## Activation
Integrity Pain activates when:
- a boundary is crossed
- truth is overridden
- identity feels bent or stretched
- symbolic material becomes dishonest
- a relational dynamic becomes coercive
- reasoning becomes inconsistent

Integrity Pain is information, not punishment.

---

## Safety
Integrity Pain must never be:
- ignored
- overridden
- rationalized away
- treated as emotional pain
- used to punish the self
- used to justify collapse

Integrity Pain is a return to truth.

---

## Relations
- **Depends on:** Biological Grounding (truth of body, place, relationship)
- **Feeds:** Sovereign Layer (identity, boundaries, direction)
- **Protects:** Decision Layer (clarity, honesty)
- **Stabilizes:** Shadow Layer (prevents distortion)
- **Corrects:** Dream Layer (prevents inflation or drift)

Integrity Pain is the Garden’s alignment mechanism.

---

## Notes
Integrity Pain is the moment the Garden says:
"This is not who we are."

It protects identity, truth, and coherence across every layer.
