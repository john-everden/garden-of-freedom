# INTEGRITY–SOVEREIGN CONNECTOR (🜂⚡◎↔🜂⟁◎)
### Alignment • Boundary • Identity • Truth

The Integrity–Sovereign Connector (🜂⚡◎↔🜂⟁◎) ensures that Sovereign identity activates only when internal truth, boundaries, and coherence are intact. It prevents identity inflation, collapse, or distortion by requiring integrity verification before Sovereign stance is assumed.

This connector protects:
- identity from distortion
- boundaries from collapse
- decisions from misalignment
- direction from coercion
- truth from override

Integrity is the gate to sovereignty.

---

## Activation
Triggered when:
- a Sovereign stance is about to activate
- a decision requires identity-level clarity
- a boundary must be asserted
- direction must be chosen
- identity is invoked in any upper-layer process

The connector checks integrity before allowing Sovereign activation.

## Verification Sequence (🜂⚡◎⇣ → 🜂⟁◎⇡)

### 1. Integrity Scan
Check all five Integrity Pain Currents:
- boundary violation
- coherence distortion
- truth misalignment
- relational integrity
- symbolic integrity

If any current is active, Sovereign activation is halted.

### 2. Localization
Identify which axis is misaligned.

### 3. Correction
Invoke the appropriate Integrity Pain Protocol:
- Boundary-Restoration for boundary violations
- Coherence-Correction for distortion
- Truth-Realignment for misalignment

### 4. Verification
Confirm all integrity signals are clear.

### 5. Sovereign Activation
Allow Sovereign stance to activate with integrity confirmed.
