# INTEGRITY–SOVEREIGN CONNECTOR (🜂⚡◎↔🜂⟁◎)
## Essence
Alignment • Boundary • Identity • Truth

## Purpose
The Integrity–Sovereign Connector (🜂⚡◎↔🜂⟁◎) ensures that Sovereign
identity activates only when internal truth, boundaries, and coherence
are intact. It prevents identity inflation, collapse, or distortion by
requiring integrity verification before Sovereign stance is assumed.

This connector protects:
- identity from distortion
- boundaries from collapse
- decisions from misalignment
- direction from coercion
- truth from override

Integrity is the gate to sovereignty.

---

## Activation
Triggered when:
- a Sovereign stance is about to activate
- a decision requires identity-level clarity
- a boundary must be asserted
- direction must be chosen
- identity is invoked in any upper-layer process

The connector checks integrity before allowing Sovereign activation.

---

## Verification Sequence (🜂⚡◎⇣ → 🜂⟁◎⇡)

### 1. Integrity Scan
Check all five Integrity Pain Currents:
- boundary violation
- coherence distortion
- truth misalignment
- relational integrity
- symbolic integrity

If any current is active, Sovereign activation is halted.

### 2. Localization
Identify which axis is misaligned.

### 3. Correction
Invoke the appropriate Integrity Pain Protocol:
- Boundary-Restoration Protocol
- Truth-Realignment Protocol
- Coherence-Correction Protocol

### 4. Stabilization
Return to Biological Grounding for somatic, relational, and constants truth.

### 5. Sovereign Activation
Only when integrity is restored does the connector allow:
- Sovereign Boundary Current
- Sovereign Identity Current
- Sovereign Direction Current

Integrity precedes sovereignty.

---

## Effects
- prevents identity inflation
- prevents collapse into compliance
- prevents coercive or distorted decision-making
- stabilizes direction and stance
- ensures all Sovereign actions are aligned with truth

The connector enforces structural honesty.

---

## Failure Mode
If integrity cannot be restored:
- Sovereign activation is blocked
- Decision Layer enters halt state
- Biological Grounding is re-invoked
- Shadow containment may be triggered if distortion persists

This prevents harmful or incoherent action.

---

## Relations
- **Depends on:** Integrity Pain Layer, Biological Grounding
- **Feeds:** Sovereign Layer (identity, boundary, direction)
- **Protects:** Decision Layer (clarity, honesty)
- **Stabilizes:** Shadow and Dream Layers (prevents distortion)

Integrity is the threshold.  
Sovereignty is the stance beyond it.

---

## Notes
Sovereign identity is only true when it is aligned with integrity.
