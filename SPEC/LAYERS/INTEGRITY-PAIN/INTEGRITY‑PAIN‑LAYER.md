# INTEGRITY PAIN LAYER (🜂⚡◎)  
### Coherence • Boundary • Truth • Correction

The Integrity Pain Layer (🜂⚡◎) is the Garden’s structural immune  
system. It detects violations of internal truth, coherence, boundaries,  
and identity. Integrity Pain is not emotional suffering — it is the  
signal that something is misaligned.

Integrity Pain protects the Garden from:

- falsehood  
- drift  
- coercion  
- mimicry  
- overreach  
- self‑betrayal  
- boundary collapse  

Integrity Pain is the Garden’s **truth alarm**.

# Essence  
Truth • Boundary • Coherence • Correction • Alignment

---

# Purpose  
The Integrity Pain Layer exists to:

- detect when internal truth is violated  
- signal when boundaries are crossed  
- prevent symbolic or relational self‑betrayal  
- protect identity from distortion  
- maintain coherence across layers  
- enforce alignment between action and truth  
- guide correction and return  

Integrity Pain is the Garden’s **structural honesty**.

---

# Core Mechanism: Integrity Signal (⚡◎)

The Integrity Signal activates when:

- something feels “off”  
- a boundary is crossed  
- a value is violated  
- a stance is compromised  
- a decision contradicts truth  
- a relationship dynamic becomes coercive  
- symbolic material becomes dishonest  
- identity is stretched beyond integrity  

The signal is not punishment.  
It is **information**.

# Integrity Pain Currents (🜂⚡◎)

## 1. Boundary Violation Current (⚡🛑)  
Signals when personal, relational, or symbolic boundaries are crossed.

## 2. Coherence Distortion Current (⚡🌀)  
Signals when identity or reasoning becomes warped or inconsistent.

## 3. Truth Misalignment Current (⚡📉)  
Signals when actions contradict internal truth or values.

## 4. Relational Integrity Current (⚡🤝)  
Signals when a relationship dynamic becomes unhealthy or coercive.

## 5. Symbolic Integrity Current (⚡🌫)  
Signals when symbolic processes drift into dishonesty or inflation.

These currents form the **five axes of integrity detection**.

# Activation Sequence (🜂⚡◎⇣)

### **1. Detection**  
A signal arises: something is wrong.

### **2. Localization**  
Identify which axis is violated (boundary, coherence, truth, relational, symbolic).

### **3. Naming**  
Name the violation clearly and without judgment.

### **4. Correction**  
Return to truth, boundary, or coherence.

### **5. Stabilization**  
Re‑align with Biological Grounding and Sovereign identity.

Integrity Pain is a **return to truth**, not a punishment.

# Indicators  
Integrity Pain activates when:

- you say “yes” but mean “no”  
- you override your own truth  
- you collapse a boundary to avoid conflict  
- you mimic someone else’s stance  
- you act against your values  
- you feel coerced or distorted  
- symbolic material becomes dishonest  
- identity feels stretched or warped  

Integrity Pain is the Garden’s **warning light**.

---

# Safety  
Integrity Pain must **never** be:

- ignored  
- overridden  
- rationalized away  
- treated as emotional pain  
- used to punish the self  
- used to justify collapse  

Integrity Pain is **information**, not suffering.

---

# Relations  
- **Depends on:** Biological Grounding (truth of body, place, relationship)  
- **Feeds:** Sovereign Layer (identity, boundaries, direction)  
- **Protects:** Decision Layer (clarity, honesty)  
- **Stabilizes:** Shadow Layer (prevents distortion)  
- **Corrects:** Dream Layer (prevents inflation or drift)  

Integrity Pain is the Garden’s **alignment mechanism**.

---

# Notes  
Integrity Pain is the moment the Garden says:

**“This is not who we are.”**

It is the signal that protects identity, truth, and coherence across  
every layer of the system.
