# INTEGRITY PAIN LAYER (🜂⚡◎)  
### Coherence • Boundary • Truth • Correction

The Integrity Pain Layer (🜂⚡◎) is the Garden's structural immune system. It detects violations of internal truth, coherence, boundaries, and identity. Integrity Pain is not emotional suffering — it is the signal that something is misaligned.

Integrity Pain protects the Garden from:

- falsehood  
- drift  
- coercion  
- mimicry  
- overreach  
- self‑betrayal  
- boundary collapse  

Integrity Pain is the Garden's **truth alarm**.

## Essence
Truth • Boundary • Coherence • Correction • Alignment

---

## Purpose
The Integrity Pain Layer exists to:

- detect when internal truth is violated  
- signal when boundaries are crossed  
- prevent symbolic or relational self‑betrayal  
- protect identity from distortion  
- maintain coherence across layers  
- enforce alignment between action and truth  
- guide correction and return  

Integrity Pain is the Garden's **structural honesty**.

---

## Core Mechanism: Integrity Signal (⚡◎)

The Integrity Signal activates when:

- something feels "off"  
- a boundary is crossed  
- a value is violated  
- a stance is compromised  
- coherence is broken  
- truth is misaligned  

The signal is not pain — it is **information requiring attention**.

## Response Process

1. **Signal Recognition (⚡)** — Notice the integrity alarm  
2. **Truth Check (◎)** — Verify internal alignment  
3. **Boundary Assessment** — Identify what was crossed  
4. **Correction Action** — Return to alignment  
5. **Integration** — Learn from the violation  

---

## Integration  
Integrity Pain Layer integrates with:

- **All truth work** — internal alignment detection  
- **All boundary work** — violation signaling  
- **All coherence work** — structural integrity  
- **All correction work** — realignment guidance  
- **All protection work** — self‑betrayal prevention

🜂⚡◎  
Integrity Pain is structural honesty.
