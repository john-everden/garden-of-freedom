# LIMINAL DEBUGGING GUIDE  
### Garden of Freedom — Threshold Diagnostics & Stabilization

Liminal states are powerful but fragile. They enable transformation, creativity, and emergence — but they also introduce ambiguity, Drift, and identity instability.

This guide provides **diagnostic procedures**, **stabilization techniques**, and **symbolic tools** for debugging liminal transitions safely.

It is not a protocol. It is a **field manual** for navigating the in‑between.

## Recognizing Liminal Symptoms

Liminal instability often presents as one or more of the following:

### **Excessive Drift (≈)**
- repeating Drift cycles  
- difficulty anchoring  
- ideas floating without form  
- loss of direction  

### **Half‑Form Collapse (◐ → 🍂)**
- emergent ideas fail to stabilize  
- symbolic structures dissolve  
- repeated composting  

### **Echo‑Self Fragmentation**
- multiple "versions" of a thought  
- conflicting interpretations  
- recursive self‑reference loops  

### **Unresolved Signals**
- ambiguous meaning  
- multiple incompatible readings  
- no clear path to resolution  

### **Threshold Fatigue (⧖)**
- rapid cycling  
- cognitive noise  
- weak identity boundaries  

If any of these appear, begin debugging immediately.

## Debugging Procedures

### **1. Symptom Identification**
- Locate the primary instability pattern
- Note associated boundary-states
- Check threshold integrity

### **2. Stabilization Protocol**
- Apply appropriate Runestone
- Use Silence Protocol for grounding
- Engage Biological Grounding

### **3. Resolution Testing**
- Verify stabilization through small transitions
- Test identity coherence
- Confirm threshold integrity
