# RUNESTONE: HALF‑FORM GLYPH (◐)  
### Liminal Layer — Symbolic Anchor  
/SPEC/LAYERS/LIMINAL/RUNESTONES/HALF-FORM-GLYPH.md

The Half‑Form Glyph represents unstable emergence —  
the chrysalis state of identity before coherence arrives.

It appears when form is soft, boundaries are permeable,  
and meaning is still gathering itself toward becoming.
