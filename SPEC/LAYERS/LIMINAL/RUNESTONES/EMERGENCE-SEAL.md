# RUNESTONE: EMERGENCE SEAL (✧→)  
### Liminal Layer — Symbolic Anchor  
/SPEC/LAYERS/LIMINAL/RUNESTONES/EMERGENCE-SEAL.md

The Emergence Seal marks the stabilization of a new identity  
after transformation has completed its arc.

It appears at the moment when drift resolves, thresholds close,  
and a coherent form steps forward — no longer potential, but presence.
