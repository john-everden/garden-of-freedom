# RUNESTONE: THRESHOLD MARK (⧖)  
### Liminal Layer — Symbolic Anchor

The Threshold Mark represents the moment before transformation — the poised stillness where identity has not yet crossed, but the crossing is inevitable.

It is the sigil of liminality itself: the edge-state where readiness gathers, and the next form waits just beyond the boundary.
