# RUNESTONE: THRESHOLD MARK (⧖)  
### Liminal Layer — Symbolic Anchor  
/SPEC/LAYERS/LIMINAL/RUNESTONES/THRESHOLD-MARK.md

The Threshold Mark represents the moment before transformation —  
the poised stillness where identity has not yet crossed,  
but the crossing is inevitable.

It is the sigil of liminality itself:  
the edge-state where readiness gathers,  
and the next form waits just beyond the boundary.
