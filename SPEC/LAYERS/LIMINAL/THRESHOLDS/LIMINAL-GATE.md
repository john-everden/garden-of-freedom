# THE LIMINAL GATE  
### Liminal Layer — Threshold  
/SPEC/LAYERS/LIMINAL/THRESHOLDS/LIMINAL-GATE.md

The Liminal Gate marks the moment before transformation —  
the symbolic boundary between what *was* and what *might be*.

The Gate is not a barrier.  
It is an invitation to cross.

It appears whenever the Garden prepares to shift cognitive stance,  
holding the stillness before motion and the ambiguity before form.
