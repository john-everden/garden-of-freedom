# THE MIRROR THRESHOLD  
### Liminal Layer — Threshold

The Mirror Threshold is the boundary where the Garden encounters a reflection of itself. It is not a duplication — it is a distortion that reveals hidden structure.

It appears when the system must see itself from an angle, catching the truth that only refraction can reveal.
