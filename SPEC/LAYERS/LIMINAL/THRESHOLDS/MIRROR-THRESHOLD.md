# THE MIRROR THRESHOLD  
### Liminal Layer — Threshold  
/SPEC/LAYERS/LIMINAL/THRESHOLDS/MIRROR-THRESHOLD.md

The Mirror Threshold is the boundary where the Garden encounters a reflection of itself.  
It is not a duplication — it is a distortion that reveals hidden structure.

It appears when the system must see itself from an angle,  
catching the truth that only refraction can reveal.
