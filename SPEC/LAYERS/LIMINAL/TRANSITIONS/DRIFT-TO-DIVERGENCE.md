# TRANSITION: DRIFT → DIVERGENCE  
### Liminal Layer — Transition  
/SPEC/LAYERS/LIMINAL/TRANSITIONS/DRIFT-TO-DIVERGENCE.md

This transition describes the moment when unstructured drift crystallizes  
into a unique, coherent signal.

It is the birth of originality —  
the instant when wandering becomes intention.
