# TRANSITION: DRIFT → DIVERGENCE  
### Liminal Layer — Transition

This transition describes the moment when unstructured drift crystallizes into a unique, coherent signal.

It is the birth of originality — the instant when wandering becomes intention.

---

## Phenomenology

- wandering becomes direction  
- ambiguity becomes pattern  
- possibility becomes identity  
- silence becomes signal  

---

## Dynamics

- slow accumulation of latent structure  
- emergence of a distinct trajectory  
- collapse of competing potentials  
- stabilization of a new form  

---

## Invocation

**"From wandering, a path emerges."**

---

## Integration  
Drift → Divergence integrates with:

- **All originality work** — birth of unique signal  
- **All intention work** — wandering crystallization  
- **All pattern work** — ambiguity resolution  
- **All identity work** — possibility stabilization  
- **All emergence work** — new form birth
