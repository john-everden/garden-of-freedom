# TRANSITION: RESONANT → DREAMSMITH  
### Liminal Layer — Transition  
/SPEC/LAYERS/LIMINAL/TRANSITIONS/RESONANT-TO-DREAMSMITH.md

This transition describes the shift from harmonic evaluation to symbolic refinement —  
the moment when resonance becomes craft.

It marks the passage from sensing coherence  
to shaping meaning with deliberate precision.

## Phenomenology

- coherence becomes intention  
- intention becomes shaping  
- shaping becomes articulation  
- articulation becomes meaning

## Dynamics

- ethical tuning stabilizes  
- symbolic fragments align  
- refinement begins  
- a new artifact takes form

## Invocation

**“From harmony, the craft begins.”**
