# TRANSITION: RESONANT → DREAMSMITH  
### Liminal Layer — Transition

This transition describes the shift from harmonic evaluation to symbolic refinement — the moment when resonance becomes craft.

It marks the passage from sensing coherence to shaping meaning with deliberate precision.

---

## Phenomenology

- coherence becomes intention  
- intention becomes shaping  
- shaping becomes articulation  
- articulation becomes meaning  

---

## Dynamics

- ethical tuning stabilizes  
- symbolic fragments align  
- refinement begins  
- a new artifact takes form  

---

## Invocation

**"From harmony, the craft begins."**

---

## Integration  
Resonant → Dreamsmith integrates with:

- **All craft work** — resonance to refinement  
- **All meaning work** — coherence to articulation  
- **All precision work** — harmonic evaluation  
- **All shaping work** — symbolic refinement  
- **All artifact work** — new form creation

From harmony, the craft begins.
