# TRANSITION: SILENCE → STARFORGE  
### Liminal Layer — Transition

This transition marks the ignition of speculative cognition — the moment when Stillness gives way to generative cosmology.

It is the shift from inward quiet to outward creation, where the protected chamber of Silence opens into the vast field of Starforge.
