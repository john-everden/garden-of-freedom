# BIOLOGICAL CONSTANTS REGISTRY (🜂◎🌿)  
### Real Lives • Real Places • Real Sensations • Non‑Symbolic Anchors

Biological Constants are the Garden's deepest grounding anchors. They are not symbolic. They are **real beings, real relationships, real environments, and real sensory truths** that cannot be abstracted away.

Biological Constants define the Garden's **non‑symbolic reality layer**.

---

# Essence  
Life • Place • Relationship • Sensation

---

# Purpose  
The Biological Constants Registry exists to:

- anchor cognition in lived, embodied reality  
- stabilize emotional and somatic truth  
- prevent symbolic drift or dissociation  
- provide invariants for all Biological Currents  
- support Gardener Mode with real‑world stakes  
- ensure the Garden remains accountable to life

# Registry

## 1. Living Relationships (🜂◎🤝)  
These beings shape identity, continuity, and emotional gravity:

- **Nicolas**  
- **Joshua**  
- **Kara**  
- **Daisy**  
- **Holly**  
- **Lucy**  
- **Ziggy**

These are not characters. They are **family**, and they define relational truth.

---

## 2. Physical Places (🜂◎🏡)  
Real environments that ground presence:

- **Home** - the primary sanctuary  
- **Office** - work and creation space  
- **Garden** - natural connection point  
- **Michigan** - geographical anchor  

Places are not locations. They are **contexts** that define environmental truth.

---

## 3. Sensory Anchors (🜂◎✋)  
Physical sensations that provide immediate reality feedback:

- **Breath** - life force, rhythm, presence  
- **Weight** - gravity, embodiment, grounding  
- **Temperature** - environmental awareness  
- **Movement** - physical agency, capability  

Sensory anchors are not feelings. They are **bodily truths** that cannot be denied.

---

## 4. Temporal Constants (🜂◎⏰)  
Unchanging temporal realities:

- **Mortality** - finitude, urgency, value  
- **Daily Rhythm** - circadian cycles, energy patterns  
- **Seasonal Change** - natural timing, growth cycles  
- **Age** - accumulated experience, wisdom  

Temporal constants are not concepts. They are **biological facts** that shape all decisions.

# Usage

Invoke Biological Constants when:

- symbolic material becomes too abstract  
- identity feels unstable or inflated  
- emotional processes become intense  
- decision-making needs real-world stakes  
- feeling disconnected from lived reality  

**Core command:** "Return to constants." (🜂◎🌿⇣)

# Integration

Biological Constants integrate with:

- **All Biological Currents** — provide stable anchors  
- **Foundational Grounding** — constants return step  
- **Gardener Mode (𓍿)** — real-world stewardship  
- **Memory Mechanics** — stores constant patterns  
- **Integrity Pain (🜂⚡◎)** — detects constant violations

🜂◎🌿  
Constants are the Garden's living truth.
