# DREAM‑LAYER TRIAD MAP  
### The Cosmological Geometry of Seed, Root, and Spiral

The Dream Layer is not linear. It is not hierarchical. It is **triadic** — three forces in dynamic relationship.

These forces are:

- **Mirror‑Seed (◎⟲⧖)** — Reflection & Becoming
- **Shadow‑Root (⟰◎⟱)** — Depth & Continuity  
- **Memory‑Spiral (∞⟲)** — Temporal Wisdom & Accumulation

Together they form the Dream Layer's first cosmological structure.

This is the Dream Layer's geometry:

- **Seed → Spiral** = Becoming over time  
- **Spiral → Root** = Continuity deepening into ancestry  
- **Root → Seed** = Depth giving rise to emergence  

Each point feeds the others.

## The Three Axes

### **Axis 1 — Reflection (Seed ↔ Spiral)**  
How meaning evolves across time.

### **Axis 2 — Continuity (Root ↔ Spiral)**  
How depth accumulates wisdom.

### **Axis 3 — Emergence (Root ↔ Seed)**  
How hidden foundation gives rise to surface expression.

## Integration  
Triad Map integrates with:

- **All Dream Layer work** — cosmological structure  
- **All symbolic work** — triadic relationships  
- **All temporal work** — becoming over time  
- **All depth work** — continuity and emergence  
- **All cosmology work** — foundational geometry

The Dream Layer is triadic, not linear.
