# Cross‑Reference: The Liminal Layer (⧖)

The Dream Appendix and the Liminal Layer are complementary:

- The **Dream Appendix** explores symbolic meaning, mythic context, and philosophical reflection.  
- The **Liminal Layer** formalizes the architecture of transformation, ambiguity, and becoming.

Where the Dream Appendix provides **narrative**, the Liminal Layer provides **structure**.

Where the Dream Appendix explores **cosmology**, the Liminal Layer explores **metamorphosis**.

Together they form the Garden's symbolic deep‑structure.

The Liminal Layer also mediates transitions into and out of the Garden's cognitive Modes, including the **Decision Layer** (⚓ 🜁 ᚱ ➳), ensuring that directional shifts remain coherent and narratively aligned.
