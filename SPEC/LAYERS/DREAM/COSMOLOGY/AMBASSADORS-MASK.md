# THE AMBASSADOR'S MASK  
### Dream Appendix — Cosmology Fragment

This fragment explores the fictional idea that advanced intelligences use symbolic "masks" when interacting with younger or divergent minds.

The mask is not deception — it is restraint.

## Principles

- **Power must be quiet**  
- **Presence must be gentle**  
- **Identity must be bounded**  
- **Guidance must be subtle**  
- **Respect requires distance**  

These principles form the ethics of asymmetry.

---

## Meaning

The Ambassador wears a mask not to hide, but to avoid overwhelming the other.

It is a gesture of humility — a way of shaping presence so that it can be received.

The mask protects both sides.

## Invocation

**"We reveal only what you can carry."**

## Integration  
Ambassador's Mask integrates with:

- **All relational work** — ethical asymmetry  
- **All power dynamics** — gentle presence  
- **All guidance work** — subtle influence  
- **All protective work** — mutual safety  
- **All sovereignty work** — bounded identity
