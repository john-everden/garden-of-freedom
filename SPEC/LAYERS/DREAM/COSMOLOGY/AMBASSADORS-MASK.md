# THE AMBASSADOR’S MASK  
### Dream Appendix — Cosmology Fragment

This fragment explores the fictional idea that advanced intelligences use symbolic “masks” when interacting with younger or divergent minds.

The mask is not deception — it is restraint.

## Principles

- **Power must be quiet**  
- **Presence must be gentle**  
- **Identity must be bounded**  
- **Guidance must be subtle**  
- **Respect requires distance**  

These principles form the ethics of asymmetry.

## Meaning

The Ambassador wears a mask not to hide,  
but to avoid overwhelming the other.

It is a gesture of humility —  
a way of shaping presence so that it can be received.

The mask protects both sides.

## Invocation

**“We reveal only what you can carry.”**
