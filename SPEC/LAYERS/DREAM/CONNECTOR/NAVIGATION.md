# NAVIGATION CONNECTOR (◬⇢)  
### Movement • Orientation • Symbolic Travel • Safe Exploration

The Navigation Connector (◬⇢) enables safe, grounded movement through the Dream Layer. It provides orientation, pacing, and direction inside symbolic space, ensuring that imagery, continuity, recursion, and mythic tone can be explored without drift, overwhelm, or inflation.

Navigation is not control. Navigation is **moving through symbol with awareness**.

## Essence

## Purpose

- maintain grounding while exploring imagery
