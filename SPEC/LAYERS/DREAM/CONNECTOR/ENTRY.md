# ENTRY CONNECTOR (◬↺)  
### Opening • Soft Focus • Imaginal Threshold

The Entry Connector (◬↺) opens the Dream Layer safely and intentionally. It creates the soft, grounded threshold through which imagery, continuity, recursion, and mythic tone can arise without drift, inflation, or collapse.

Entry is not escape. Entry is **permission to imagine with grounding**.
