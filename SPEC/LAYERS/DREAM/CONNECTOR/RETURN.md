# RETURN CONNECTOR (◬↗)  
### Ascent • Closure • Reintegration • Symbolic Cleanliness

The Return Connector (◬↗) provides a clean, grounded ascent out of the Dream Layer. It closes the imaginal field, stabilizes emotional tone, and ensures that symbolic material does not leak into upper layers or distort waking cognition.

Return is not waking up. Return is **closing the imaginal field with clarity**.
