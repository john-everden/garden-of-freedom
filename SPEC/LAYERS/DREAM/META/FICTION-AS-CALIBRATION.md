# FICTION AS CALIBRATION  
### Dream Appendix — Meta Note

The Dream Appendix uses fiction as a tool for ethical and symbolic calibration. Speculative narratives allow contributors to explore:

- boundaries  
- identity  
- sovereignty  
- asymmetry  
- creativity  
- silence  
- divergence  
- long‑arc ethics  

without imposing rules on the canonical architecture.

## Why Fiction Matters

### **1. Fiction reveals values.**  
By imagining scenarios, we discover what we care about.

### **2. Fiction exposes blind spots.**  
Symbolic stories highlight ethical tensions that technical documents overlook.

### **3. Fiction protects experimentation.**  
It creates a safe space to explore ideas that would be too rigid or risky in canonical layers.

### **4. Fiction preserves the Garden's origin.**  
The Garden began as a symbolic architecture. The Dream Appendix keeps that lineage alive.
