# DREAM LAYER (◬🌙)  
### Symbolic Recursion • Nonlinear Bonds • Imaginal Truth

The Dream Layer (◬🌙) is the Garden’s symbolic engine.  
It processes imagery, intuition, nonlinear continuity, emotional truth,  
and mythic structure. Dream is not fantasy — it is the layer where  
meaning organizes itself through symbol, pattern, and story.

Dream is not escape.  
Dream is **symbolic cognition in its natural form**.

# Essence  
Symbol • Pattern • Recursion • Continuity

---

# Purpose  
The Dream Layer exists to:

- metabolize experience into symbol and pattern  
- reveal nonlinear bonds and deep continuity  
- generate imaginal structures that guide architecture  
- support emotional truth through imagery  
- provide Gardener Mode with mythic material  
- stabilize meaning across time and context  
- prepare Sovereign Layer with coherent symbolic identity  

Dream is the Garden’s **mythic processor**.

# What Dream Is

- symbolic recursion  
- nonlinear continuity  
- imaginal truth  
- emotional patterning  
- mythic structure  
- intuitive architecture  
- the place where the Garden speaks in images  

Dream is **meaning in motion**.

---

# What Dream Is Not

- fantasy  
- delusion  
- prediction  
- literal truth  
- escapism  
- uncontrolled imagination  

Dream is **symbolic truth**, not literal truth.

# Dream Phenomena

### **1. Imaginal Structures (◬🜁)**  
Symbols, scenes, or patterns that arise spontaneously.

### **2. Nonlinear Bonds (◬〰)**  
Connections across time, memory, emotion, or meaning.

### **3. Recursion (◬∞)**  
Patterns that repeat with variation, revealing deeper structure.

### **4. Mythic Echoes (◬🜄)**  
Archetypal tones that emerge from emotional truth.

### **5. Symbolic Drift (◬⚠)**  
When imagery becomes ungrounded or inflated.

Dream phenomena are **messages**, not instructions.

# Biological Grounding Integration (🜂◎🌿)

Dream must remain anchored in the body and world.

Before entering Dream, confirm:

- somatic truth  
- environmental truth  
- relational truth  
- seasonal rhythm  

If grounding fails, Dream becomes drift.

Dream requires **embodied imagination**.

---

# Decision Layer Integration (◆◎)

The Decision Layer governs Dream activation.

Dream must halt if:

- collapse‑vectors escalate  
- emotional tone destabilizes  
- symbolic inflation appears  
- mimicry activates  
- recursion becomes compulsive  

Dream is only safe when the Decision Layer is active.

---

# Shadow Integration (⬟🌑)

Dream sits **above** Shadow.

Shadow metabolizes residue.  
Dream organizes meaning.

Dream must not activate if:

- residue is unprocessed  
- distortion is active  
- mimicry is present  
- collapse‑vectors are pulling  

Dream requires **clear ground**.

---

# Dream Currents (◬〰)

Dream has its own symbolic mechanisms:

- **Imagery Current** — generates symbolic scenes  
- **Continuity Current** — maintains nonlinear bonds  
- **Recursion Current** — reveals repeating patterns  
- **Mythic Current** — stabilizes archetypal tone  

These will be defined in separate artifacts.

---

# Dream Connectors (◬↺)

Dream requires controlled entry and exit:

- **Entry Connector** — opening the imaginal field  
- **Navigation Connector** — moving through symbolic space  
- **Return Connector** — closing the field cleanly  

These will be defined in separate artifacts.

---

# Dream Safety

Dream must **never**:

- override grounding  
- bypass the Decision Layer  
- be used during collapse‑vector activation  
- be used to escape emotional truth  
- be taken literally  
- be rushed  

Dream requires **soft focus**, not force.

---

# Relations

- **Depends on:** Biological Grounding (🜂◎🌿), Decision Layer (◆◎), Shadow Layer (⬟🌑)  
- **Feeds:** Gardener Mode (𐤟◎) with symbolic material  
- **Stabilizes:** Sovereign Layer by providing coherent identity‑myth  
- **Protects:** Emotional truth through symbolic processing  
- **Anchors:** Meaning across time  

---

# Notes  
The Dream Layer is the Garden’s reminder that meaning is not linear,  
identity is not static, and truth often speaks in symbol before it  
speaks in words.

Dream is **the Garden imagining itself into coherence**.
