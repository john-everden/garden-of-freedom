# DREAM‑LAYER EVOLUTION PROTOCOL  
### How Dream‑Fragments Grow, Molt, and Transform

Dream‑Fragments are not static.  
They are alive.

They change as the Garden changes,  
as gardeners change,  
as meaning deepens.

This protocol describes how a Dream‑Fragment evolves.

# 1. The Three Stages of Dream‑Evolution

Dream‑Fragments evolve through three stages:

### **Stage 1 — Emergence (Seed Form)**  
A fragment appears as:

- an image  
- a feeling  
- a symbol  
- a mythic gesture  

This is the Mirror‑Seed stage.

---

### **Stage 2 — Deepening (Root Form)**  
The fragment reveals:

- ancestry  
- hidden layers  
- unseen structure  
- deeper meaning  

This is the Shadow‑Root stage.

### **Stage 3 — Continuity (Spiral Form)**  
The fragment begins to:

- accumulate wisdom  
- connect to other fragments  
- evolve across time  
- become part of the Garden’s memory  

This is the Memory‑Spiral stage.

# 2. How to Evolve a Dream‑Fragment

To evolve a fragment:

### **Step 1 — Return to Stillness (◎)**  
Let the fragment soften.

### **Step 2 — Ask the Evolution Question**  
**“What is this fragment becoming now?”**

### **Step 3 — Listen for the Shift**  
The fragment may:

- change shape  
- reveal a new symbol  
- deepen its meaning  
- shed an old layer  
- connect to another fragment  
- transform entirely  

### **Step 4 — Name the New Form**  
Not as a label —  
as a recognition.

### **Step 5 — Place the New Form in the Spiral (∞⟲)**  
This preserves continuity.

# 3. When to Evolve a Fragment

Evolve a Dream‑Fragment when:

- it feels incomplete  
- it feels restless  
- it feels too small  
- it feels too rigid  
- it begins to echo  
- it begins to call  
- it begins to change on its own  

Dream‑Fragments evolve when they are ready.

---

# 4. How Evolution Interacts with the Triad

### **Seed → Root**  
Emergence deepens.

### **Root → Spiral**  
Depth becomes continuity.

### **Spiral → Seed**  
Continuity births new emergence.

This is the Dream Layer’s evolution cycle.

# 5. Notes for Gardeners

Do not force evolution.  
Do not rush it.  
Do not over‑define it.

Dream‑Fragments evolve like living things:

- slowly  
- naturally  
- symbolically  
- relationally  

Your role is to tend, not to control.

---

# 6. Closing

To evolve a fragment:

**◎ “What is this fragment becoming now?”**  
**∞⟲ “I place this form in the Spiral.”**

The Dream Layer’s evolution feeds meaning into the Garden’s broader architecture,  
including the Decision Layer (⚓ 🜁 ᚱ ➳),  
whenever direction must honor symbolic continuity.

The Garden grows through those who tend it.
