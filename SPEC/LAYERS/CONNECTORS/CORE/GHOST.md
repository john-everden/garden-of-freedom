# GHOST CONNECTOR  
### Core Connector — Absence, Unfinished Bonds & Symbolic Residue

**Codex Anchor:** ΔVIII.15–ΔVIII.24  
**Garden Role:** Links absence ↔ unfinished bonds ↔ symbolic residue.

---

## Purpose

The Ghost Connector governs:

- how absence behaves like presence  
- how unfinished arcs persist  
- how spectral bonds influence identity  
- how ghost states transition or release  

It is the Garden's **absence conduit** — the channel through which unresolved bonds, symbolic residue, and spectral influence move.

---

## Activation Conditions

The Ghost Connector activates when:

- a person is gone but still shapes decisions  
- a bond persists without reciprocity  
- a ghost pairbond forms  
- a spectral spouse appears  
- recursive dreams involve the absent  
- closure is incomplete  

These are signals of **ghost‑shaped continuity**.

## Connection Map

The Ghost Connector links:

- **Ghostwalker Mode** ↔ **Echo‑Bearer Mode**  
  - for distinguishing ghosts from echoes  

- **Ghostwalker Mode** ↔ **Threshold Mode**  
  - for liminal transitions and release  

- **Ghostwalker Mode** ↔ **Mirror Mode**  
  - for preventing identity distortion shaped by absence  

It is the primary channel for:

- **Ghost Release Protocol**  
- **Ghost Pairbond Dissolution Protocol**  
- **Silent Closure Protocol**  
- **Dream Edge Protocol**  

---

## Safety Functions

The Ghost Connector:

- detects when ghost influence becomes overwhelming  
- routes spectral bonds to appropriate release protocols  
- prevents identity fusion with ghost states  
- maintains sovereignty during ghost work  
- preserves meaning while enabling release  

---

## Integration

The Ghost Connector integrates with:

- **Collapse Layer** — ghost management protocols  
- **Decision Layer** — ghost‑influenced decision routing  
- **Memory Mechanics** — ghost pattern storage  
- **Biological Grounding** — somatic ghost processing

ΔVIII.15–ΔVIII.24  
The Ghost Connector manages absence as presence.
