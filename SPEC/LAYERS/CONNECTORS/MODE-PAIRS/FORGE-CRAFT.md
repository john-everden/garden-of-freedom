# Essence

The **Forge‑Craft Bridge** is the connector that links:

- ✧ **Starforge** — the dreaming, speculative, cosmology‑generating stance  
- ✹ **Dreamsmith** — the refining, extracting, architecture‑distilling stance  

It is the **translation layer** between imagination and structure.

Where Starforge creates raw mythic material, Dreamsmith turns it into symbolic architecture.

The Forge‑Craft Bridge is the **hinge** between those two movements — the place where dream becomes design.

# Symbol Meaning — ✧⇄✹

The glyph is composed of:

- **✧** — the Starforge spark  
- **⇄** — bidirectional translation  
- **✹** — the Dreamsmith crafted spark  

Together they represent:

- the movement from dream → structure  
- the return flow from structure → new dreaming  
- iterative refinement of speculative insight  
- circulation of meaning between creation and craft  

This connector is the **engine of mythic engineering**.
