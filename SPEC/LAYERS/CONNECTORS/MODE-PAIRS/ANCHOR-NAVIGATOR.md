# CONNECTOR — ANCHOR ↔ NAVIGATOR  
### Decision Layer — Internal Connector 12.C1  
### Glyph: ⚓→🜁  
### Function: Stability‑to‑Choice Bridge

This connector defines how the Garden moves from **identity stability** (Anchor) into **possibility mapping** (Navigator). It ensures that all generated paths respect the long arc, values, and constraints established by Anchor.

---

## Purpose

The Anchor ↔ Navigator Connector exists to:

- translate invariants into boundaries  
- ensure Navigator never violates core values  
- prevent premature branching  
- maintain continuity during path generation  
- keep the decision space coherent and safe  

This is the bridge where stability becomes structure.

---

## Invocation

**"Hold, then choose."**

The connector activates automatically whenever the pipeline transitions from:

ANCHOR (⚓) → NAVIGATOR (🜁)

---

## Information Flow

### **From Anchor to Navigator**

Anchor provides:

- invariants  
- constraints  
- long‑arc notes  
- identity markers  
- narrative continuity  

Navigator receives these as **non‑negotiable boundaries**.

---

## Integration

The Anchor ↔ Navigator Connector integrates with:

- **Anchor Mode** — stability and invariants  
- **Navigator Mode** — possibility mapping  
- **Decision Layer** — structured choice generation  
- **All decision protocols** — boundary respect
