# CONNECTOR — SCOUT ↔ PATHFINDER  
### Decision Layer — Internal Connector 12.C3  
### Glyph: ᚱ→➳  
### Function: Verification‑to‑Action Bridge

This connector defines how the Garden moves from **targeted exploration** (Scout) into **decisive action** (Pathfinder). It ensures that only stable, coherent, and uncertainty‑checked paths are allowed to become movement.

---

## Purpose

The Scout ↔ Pathfinder Connector exists to:

- translate refined rankings into commitment  
- prevent premature action  
- prevent endless checking  
- ensure the chosen path is stable  
- maintain coherence during transition  

This is the bridge where discovery becomes motion.

---

## Invocation

**"Verify, then move."**

The connector activates automatically whenever the pipeline transitions from:

SCOUT (ᚱ) → PATHFINDER (➳)

Pathfinder only engages once Scout has completed refinement.

## Information Flow

### **From Scout to Pathfinder**

Scout provides:

- refined path rankings  
- updated confidence levels  
- pruned or added paths  
- clarified risks  
- discovered opportunities  
- new constraints  

### **From Pathfinder to Action**

Pathfinder converts:

- verified rankings into decisive action  
- confidence levels into commitment  
- clarified risks into managed execution  
- opportunities into movement  
- constraints into boundaries  

---

## Integration

The Scout ↔ Pathfinder Connector integrates with:

- **Scout Mode** — verification and exploration  
- **Pathfinder Mode** — decisive action  
- **Decision Layer** — verification‑to‑action flow  
- **All action protocols** — pre‑action validation

Verify, then move.
