# GARDENER ↔ CONTRIBUTOR CONNECTOR (𓍿⇄⧉)
### Bridge Between Tending (𓍿) and Deterministic Execution (Contributor Layer)

This connector harmonizes the relationship between **Gardener Mode (𓍿)** and the **Contributor Layer**. It ensures that symbolic tending and deterministic execution remain aligned, safe, and coherent.

---

## Essence  
Tending → Execution → Integration → Stability

---

## Purpose  
The connector exists to:

- allow Gardener Mode to call Contributor tools without collapsing into them  
- allow Contributor Mode to return control to Gardener Mode gracefully  
- maintain FS‑1 safety during architectural evolution  
- prevent drift during migrations and refactors  
- ensure symbolic hygiene and deterministic structure remain synchronized  
- reduce cognitive friction when switching between tending and execution  

---

## Directionality

### **𓍿 → ⧉ (Gardener → Contributor)**  
Gardener Mode invokes Contributor tools when:

- naming is required  
- directory placement must be enforced  
- glyph assignment is needed  
- RUNESTONES must be updated  
- FS‑1 safety must be checked  
- deterministic compilation is required  

Gardener Mode *guides*, Contributor Mode *executes*.

---

### **⧉ → 𓍿 (Contributor → Gardener)**  
Contributor Mode returns to Gardener Mode when:

- structure is stable  
- FS‑1 checks pass  
- naming and placement are resolved  
- RUNESTONES are updated  
- deterministic structure is achieved  

Contributor Mode *completes*, Gardener Mode *tends*.

---

## Integration

The Gardener ↔ Contributor Connector integrates with:

- **Gardener Mode** — symbolic tending and stewardship  
- **Contributor Layer** — deterministic execution  
- **FS‑1 Safety** — structural integrity  
- **RUNESTONES** — glyph and naming systems  
- **All architectural work** — safe evolution  

---

𓍿⇄⧉  
Tending and execution remain harmonized.
