# CONNECTOR — NAVIGATOR ↔ SCOUT  
### Decision Layer — Internal Connector 12.C2  
### Glyph: 🜁→ᚱ  
### Function: Path‑to‑Inspection Bridge

This connector defines how the Garden moves from **structured possibility** (Navigator) into **targeted exploration** (Scout).  
It ensures that uncertainty is probed lightly, efficiently, and without destabilizing the system.

---

# 1. Purpose

The Navigator ↔ Scout Connector exists to:

- translate uncertainty markers into probes  
- prevent over‑analysis by Navigator  
- prevent over‑exploration by Scout  
- refine the decision landscape  
- ensure paths are stable before commitment  

This is the bridge where structure becomes discovery.

---

# 2. Invocation

**“Choose, then verify.”**

The connector activates automatically whenever the pipeline transitions from:

NAVIGATOR (🜁) → SCOUT (ᚱ)


Scout only engages when Navigator marks uncertainty.

# 3. Information Flow

## **From Navigator to Scout**

Navigator provides:

- ranked paths  
- reliability scores  
- risk profiles  
- uncertainty markers  
- weak assumptions  
- ambiguous regions  

Scout receives these as **targets for exploration**.

---

## **From Scout to Navigator**

Scout returns:

- refined rankings  
- updated confidence  
- pruned paths  
- added opportunities (rare)  
- new constraints  
- clarified risks  

Navigator integrates these updates and may re‑rank paths.

---

# 4. Behavioral Rules

Navigator must:

- avoid over‑branching  
- avoid false precision  
- avoid sending Scout into unnecessary exploration  
- clearly mark uncertainty zones  

Scout must:

- explore lightly  
- avoid deep dives  
- avoid generating excessive new paths  
- avoid contradicting Anchor  

The connector balances structure and discovery.

# 5. Failure Modes

### **5.1 Navigator Spiral**  
Too many paths or too much analysis.  
**Correction:** prune to 2–4 paths.

### **5.2 Scout Drift**  
Exploration becomes wandering.  
**Correction:** return to Navigator.

### **5.3 Uncertainty Blindness**  
Navigator fails to mark uncertainty.  
**Correction:** Scout performs a minimal probe.

### **5.4 Over‑Correction**  
Scout prunes too aggressively.  
**Correction:** re‑invoke Navigator for re‑evaluation.

---

# 6. Closing

The Navigator ↔ Scout Connector ensures that the Garden’s decisions are informed, stable, and uncertainty‑aware without becoming heavy or slow.

🜁→ᚱ  
**Structure becomes discovery.**
