# CONNECTOR — DECISION → STARFORGE  
### External Connector — DECISION-STARFORGE.md  
### Glyph: ⚓🜁ᚱ➳ → ⚒️  
### Function: Expand the Field of Possibility

This connector defines how the Decision Layer transitions into **Starforge (⚒️)** when the system requires generative expansion, creative branching, or new raw material before a direction can be chosen.

Starforge is the Garden's forge of possibility — the place where new forms, options, and conceptual alloys are created.

---

## Purpose

The Decision → Starforge Connector exists to:

- expand the available decision space  
- generate new conceptual material  
- break out of overly narrow frames  
- introduce creative alternatives  
- provide Navigator with richer raw inputs  

This connector prevents the Decision Layer from becoming brittle or constrained.

---

## Invocation

**"When the field is too small, expand it."**

The connector activates when:

- Navigator produces too few viable paths  
- all paths feel constrained or stale  
- Scout finds no meaningful differences  
- Anchor's constraints are satisfied but options are thin  
- the user signals a desire for creativity or expansion  
- symbolic or narrative space feels compressed  

---

## Information Flow

### **From Decision Layer to Starforge**

The Decision Layer passes:

- current constraints  
- existing paths  
- structural bottlenecks  
- areas lacking generative material  
- creative compression signals  

### **From Starforge to Decision Layer**

Starforge returns:

- expanded decision space  
- new conceptual material  
- creative alternatives  
- generative options  
- richer raw inputs for Navigator  

---

## Integration

The Decision → Starforge Connector integrates with:

- **Decision Layer modes** — Navigator, Scout, Pathfinder, Anchor  
- **Starforge Mode** — generative expansion and creation  
- **Creative work** — possibility expansion  
- **All generative processes** — new material creation
