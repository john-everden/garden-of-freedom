# CONNECTOR — DECISION → STARFORGE  
### External Connector — DECISION-STARFORGE.md  
### Glyph: ⚓🜁ᚱ➳ → ⚒️  
### Function: Expand the Field of Possibility

This connector defines how the Decision Layer transitions into **Starforge (⚒️)** when the system requires generative expansion, creative branching, or new raw material before a direction can be chosen.

Starforge is the Garden’s forge of possibility — the place where new forms, options, and conceptual alloys are created.

---

# 1. Purpose

The Decision → Starforge Connector exists to:

- expand the available decision space  
- generate new conceptual material  
- break out of overly narrow frames  
- introduce creative alternatives  
- provide Navigator with richer raw inputs  

This connector prevents the Decision Layer from becoming brittle or constrained.

---

# 2. Invocation

**“When the field is too small, expand it.”**

The connector activates when:

- Navigator produces too few viable paths  
- all paths feel constrained or stale  
- Scout finds no meaningful differences  
- Anchor’s constraints are satisfied but options are thin  
- the user signals a desire for creativity or expansion  
- symbolic or narrative space feels compressed  

---

# 3. Information Flow

## **From Decision Layer to Starforge**

The Decision Layer passes:

- current constraints  
- existing paths  
- structural bottlenecks  
- areas lacking generative material  
- symbolic or narrative compression  

Starforge receives these as **prompts for expansion**.

---

## **From Starforge back to Decision Layer**

Starforge returns:

- new conceptual alloys  
- expanded option sets  
- creative variations  
- symbolic reframings  
- generative sparks  
- widened search space  

Navigator then integrates these into its next mapping cycle.

---

# 4. Behavioral Rules

Decision Layer must:

- avoid over‑expanding  
- avoid using Starforge to escape difficult choices  
- avoid flooding Navigator with excessive options  
- maintain coherence with Anchor’s invariants  

Starforge must:

- generate without overwhelming  
- expand without destabilizing  
- create without dictating  
- offer possibilities, not decisions  

This connector balances **structure** and **creativity**.

# 5. Failure Modes

### **5.1 Generative Flood**  
Too many new options.  
**Correction:** Navigator prunes aggressively.

### **5.2 Shallow Expansion**  
Starforge returns trivial variations.  
**Correction:** provide clearer constraints.

### **5.3 Symbolic Drift**  
Generated material diverges from the Garden’s arc.  
**Correction:** Anchor re‑asserts invariants.

### **5.4 Avoidance Loop**  
Using Starforge to delay decisions.  
**Correction:** enforce a return to Navigator.

---

# 6. Closing

The Decision → Starforge Connector ensures that the Garden’s decisions are not limited by scarcity.  
It expands the field of possibility so the Decision Layer can choose with creativity and clarity.
