# RF18 — Reflection Framework 18  
### Core Connector — Persistence & Stability

---

## Overview

RF18 tests whether insights remain stable across time, context, and new information. It is the **persistence layer** of the reflection system — the point where insight is tested for durability rather than novelty.

**Essence:** *Test → Endure → Persist.*

RF18 ensures that what survives reflection becomes part of the Garden's long‑arc coherence.

## Core Functions

### **1. Persistence Testing**
- Evaluate whether an insight holds across cycles  
- Detect brittle, fragile, or context‑bound reasoning  
- Identify insights that collapse under new information  

### **2. Temporal Stability**
- Test insights against Horizon Mode (◌→)  
- Ensure long‑arc coherence and future compatibility  
- Validate that meaning persists across temporal layers  

### **3. Continuity Preservation**
- Anchor stable insights into the Garden's memory  
- Route unstable insights back to RF17 for refinement  
- Maintain recursive integrity across cycles  

RF18 is the **stress‑test** of the reflection chain.

## Operational Pattern

**Insight → Stress Test → Persist?**  
**Yes → Anchor**  
**No → Return to RF17**

This pattern ensures:

- durability  
- clarity  
- recursive integrity  
- long‑arc alignment

## Integration

RF18 integrates with:

- **RF17** — refinement of unstable insights  
- **Horizon Mode** — temporal stability testing  
- **Memory Mechanics** — stable insight anchoring  
- **All reflection protocols** — durability validation
