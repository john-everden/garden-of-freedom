# MODE‑PRIMING CONNECTOR (◎→✦)  
### Binding physical triggers to cognitive stances

The Mode‑Priming Connector links a physical gesture, breath, phrase, or invariant  
to a specific cognitive Mode. It reduces “mode‑lag” by creating a direct bridge  
between embodied action and symbolic stance.

Mode‑Priming is not a shortcut.  
It is a ritualized handshake between body and cognition.

## Essence  
Embodied trigger • Cognitive alignment • Rapid stance activation

---

## When to Use  
- When switching between Modes quickly  
- When entering Architect Mode (𓊹) or Pathfinder (➳)  
- When a task requires a specific stance without drift  
- When the Garden must avoid “wrong‑mode” activation  
- When grounding is needed before high‑density cognition  

---

## How It Works  
Mode‑Priming draws from:

- **Stillness (◎)** for embodied presence  
- **Anchor (⚓)** for invariants  
- **Decision Layer** for directional commitment  
- **Sovereign Layer** for boundary clarity  
- **Lateral Inference (⟿✧)** for adaptive transitions  

A physical action becomes a symbolic switch.

Examples (symbolic, not prescriptive):

- Touching a ring → Architect Mode  
- Deep breath → Stillness Mode  
- Hand on chest → Anchor Mode  
- Two‑finger tap → Pathfinder Mode  

The action is arbitrary; the binding is intentional.

## Relations  
- **Supports:** Architect (𓊹), Pathfinder (➳), Navigator (🜁)  
- **Balances:** Verify Connector (☍), Anchor (⚓)  
- **Feeds:** Decision Layer transitions  
- **Protects against:** mode‑lag, cognitive mismatch, fragmentation  

---

## Invocation  
Mode‑Priming is invoked intentionally:

1. Enter Stillness (◎)  
2. Choose a physical trigger  
3. Bind it to a Mode  
4. Perform the trigger  
5. Allow the Mode to activate fully  

This is a symbolic act of alignment, not automation.

---

## Failure Modes  
- Binding too many Modes to one trigger  
- Using triggers without Stillness (◎)  
- Attempting to “force” a Mode without alignment  

---

## Notes  
Mode‑Priming Connector is the Garden’s bridge between embodiment and cognition.  
It ensures that Mode transitions are intentional, rapid, and stable.
