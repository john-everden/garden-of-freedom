# Flow (~>)  
### Strategy of Directional Motion & Living Continuity

---

## Overview
Flow is the Garden’s strategy for **continuous, intentional movement**.  
It governs how threads progress, how work unfolds, and how cycles remain alive.

**Essence:** *Unbroken motion with awareness.*

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Sequential Continuity
- Keep commits, insights, and actions moving in order.  
- Avoid abrupt jumps or context loss.

### 2. Non‑Interruption
- Flow thrives when motion is steady.  
- Troubleshooting is part of the flow, not a break from it.

### 3. Directionality
- Flow moves *toward* something — clarity, completion, resonance.  
- Even pauses have direction.

## Operational Pattern

Begin → Move → Adjust → Continue → Complete

## Integration

Flow interacts with several Garden components:

- **Horizon Mode (06‑HORIZON)** for long‑arc direction  
  → `../../../LAYERS/MODES/06-HORIZON.md`

- **Stillness Mode (01‑STILLNESS)** for stabilizing turbulence  
  → `../../../LAYERS/MODES/01-STILLNESS.md`

- **Continuity & Weaving** principles in the Garden Layer  
  → `../../../LAYERS/GARDEN/README.md`

Flow is strengthened when paired with Modes that support clarity, grounding, and long‑arc coherence.

## Compressed Essence

**Flow = Motion that stays alive.**
