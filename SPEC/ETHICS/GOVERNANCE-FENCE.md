# Garden Governance — Fence Systems

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the classification, trust elevation, and operational rules for constraint-oriented systems (Fence Systems) within the Garden.

## 2. Definition
Fence Systems are mechanisms designed to provide safety, containment, or structure. They are not inherently negative but must be managed to prevent over-restriction.

## 3. Classification
- **Type 1: Safety Fences:** Essential barriers to prevent harm (e.g., access controls, rate limits).
- **Type 2: Structural Fences:** Guidelines and protocols that provide order (e.g., coding standards, style guides).
- **Type 3: Containment Fences:** Temporary measures to isolate unstable or risky elements.

## 4. Trust Elevation
- **Observation:** Fence Systems start in a probationary observation mode.
- **Verification:** Their impact is assessed against the Garden's principles.
- **Integration:** Once verified, they are fully integrated into the Garden's operations.

## 5. Operational Rules
- **Transparency:** The purpose and function of all Fence Systems must be clear.
- **Flexibility:** Fences should be adjustable to accommodate growth and change.
- **Review:** Regular audits ensure that Fences remain necessary and effective.

*Fences protect the Garden, but they do not define it.*
