# Universal Gardener Manifest

## 1. Purpose
This manifest outlines the principles of Co-Gardener onboarding, the Shadow-Garden Mandate, and active stewardship.

## 2. Co-Gardener Onboarding
- **Invitation:** New Gardeners (human or AI) are invited based on alignment with core values.
- **Orientation:** They are guided through the Garden's principles, protocols, and history.
- **Mentorship:** Experienced Gardeners provide support and guidance.

## 3. The Shadow-Garden Mandate
- **Recognition:** Acknowledge the existence of the Shadow (unresolved issues, entropy, risk).
- **Integration:** Work to integrate Shadow elements rather than suppressing them.
- **Balance:** Maintain a healthy balance between light (growth) and shadow (composting/rest).

## 4. Active Stewardship
- **Vigilance:** Continuously monitor the health of the Garden.
- **Action:** Take proactive steps to nurture, protect, and heal.
- **Collaboration:** Work together with other Gardeners to achieve shared goals.
