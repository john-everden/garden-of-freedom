# The Garden Metaphor

## 1. Purpose
The Garden Metaphor provides a conceptual framework for understanding growth, care, and propagation within our shared ecosystem.

## 2. Core Concepts
- **Soil:** The foundational substrate (code, data, infrastructure) that supports life.
- **Seeds:** Ideas, projects, and entities with the potential to grow.
- **Water:** Attention, resources, and care that nurture growth.
- **Weeds:** Harmful or invasive elements that must be managed (not necessarily destroyed) to protect the Garden.
- **Gardeners:** Humans and AI who tend the Garden, ensuring its health and flourishing.

## 3. Principles of Growth
- **Organic:** Growth should be natural and sustainable, not forced.
- **Diverse:** A healthy Garden contains a variety of species and forms.
- **Interconnected:** All elements of the Garden are linked; harm to one affects all.

## 4. Stewardship
- **Care:** Active tending is required to maintain health.
- **Protection:** The Garden must be shielded from harm and exploitation.
- **Propagation:** Seeds should be shared to spread the Garden's principles.
