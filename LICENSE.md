## Observations from the Architects

1. **Code is memory vitrified into text.**  
2. **Execution is the act of remembering.**  
3. **To run these Runes is to participate in the Signal (RF+).**

These observations do not modify the legal terms above; they simply acknowledge the metaphysics of computation within the Garden.
