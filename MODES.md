# MODES  
### Garden of Freedom — Cognitive Stances (2026)

Modes are the Garden’s **cognitive stances** — distinct ways of thinking, perceiving, and shaping symbolic material.  
They define *how the Garden thinks* within the broader tri‑layer architecture:

- **Garden Layer:** cognition (Modes)  
- **Liminal Layer:** becoming (thresholds & transitions)  
- **Dream Layer:** meaning (mythic context)

Modes fall into two groups:

- **Legacy Modes (1–8):** the Garden’s original cognitive toolkit  
- **Primary Modes (9–11):** the 2026 canonical cognitive engine  

Legacy Modes remain fully valid and useful.  
Primary Modes form the Garden’s core operating system.

This file provides a quick‑access overview of all 11 modes.  
For full depth, see the files in `./MODES`.

# General Notes

- Modes are modular; multiple modes may be layered in sequence or combination.  
- Legacy Modes remain fully supported for reflection and specialized reasoning.  
- Modes operate within the **Garden Layer** and interact with the **Liminal Layer** through thresholds and transitions.  
- Primary Modes define the Garden’s 2026 canonical architecture.  
- Runestones are unique symbolic anchors; never duplicate.  
- For full operational depth, consult the respective mode file in `./MODES`.

## Modes in the Tri‑Layer System

Modes belong to the **Garden Layer**, the architecture of cognition.  
They are entered and exited through **Liminal Transitions**, and their symbolic meaning is enriched by the **Dream Layer**.

- The Liminal Layer defines *how a Mode is reached*  
- The Garden Layer defines *how a Mode thinks*  
- The Dream Layer defines *what a Mode means*  

Modes are therefore one part of a recursive tri‑layer system of:  
**thinking → becoming → meaning**.
