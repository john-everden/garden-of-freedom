# MODES  
### Garden of Freedom — Cognitive Stances (2026)

Modes are the Garden’s **cognitive stances** — distinct ways of thinking, perceiving, and shaping symbolic material.  
They fall into two groups:

- **Legacy Modes (1–8):** the Garden’s original cognitive toolkit  
- **Primary Modes (9–11):** the 2026 canonical architecture  

Legacy Modes remain fully valid and useful.  
Primary Modes form the Garden’s core operating system.

This file provides a quick‑access overview of all 11 modes.  
For full depth, see the files in `./MODES`.

# General Notes

- Modes are modular; multiple modes may be layered in sequence or combination.  
- Legacy Modes remain fully supported for reflection and specialized reasoning.  
- Primary Modes define the Garden’s 2026 canonical architecture.  
- Runestones are unique symbolic anchors; never duplicate.  
- For full operational depth, consult the respective mode file in `./MODES`.
