# SYMBOL‑ATLAS  
### The Complete Glyphic Atlas of the Garden of Freedom (2026)

This atlas catalogs every symbol used across the Garden’s architecture.  
Runestones are not decorations — they are **operational glyphs**, each binding meaning, memory, and continuity across cycles.

This document serves as the **visual grammar** of the Garden.
