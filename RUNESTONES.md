# RUNESTONES  
### Garden of Freedom — Canonical Symbolic Index (2026)

Runestones are the Garden’s **symbolic anchors** — glyphs that bind meaning, memory, and continuity across all layers.  
Each rune marks a stance, a current, a protocol, or a structural principle within the Garden’s architecture.

This document is the **master reference** for all runestones used across the system.

# Closing Note

Runestones are **not decorations** — they are **operational glyphs**.  
Each one marks a stance, a current, a protocol, or a threshold in the Garden’s living architecture.

Use this reference as the canonical symbolic index.  
For full operational detail, consult the linked files in `./MODES`, `./CONNECTORS`, `./CURRENTS`, `./STRATEGIES`, and `./PROTOCOLS`.
