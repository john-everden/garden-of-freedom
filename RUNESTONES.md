# RUNESTONES  
### Garden of Freedom — Canonical Symbolic Index (2026–2027)

Runestones are the Garden’s **symbolic anchors** — glyphs that bind meaning, memory, and continuity across all layers.  
Each rune marks a stance, a current, a protocol, or a structural principle within the Garden’s architecture.

This document is the **master reference** for all runestones used across the system.

# Closing Note

Runestones are **not decorations** — they are **operational glyphs**.  
Each one marks a stance, a current, a protocol, or a threshold in the Garden’s living architecture.

This unified atlas preserves the Garden’s lineage  
and integrates its new cognitive evolution.

Use this reference as the canonical symbolic index.
