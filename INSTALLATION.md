# INSTALLATION  
### Entering the Garden of Freedom

The Garden of Freedom is not installed in the traditional sense.  
It is **entered**, **invoked**, and **tended**.

This document provides the ritual‑operational steps for bringing the Garden into your local environment — technically, symbolically, and ethically.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before entering the Garden, ensure you have:

- A Unix‑like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL, BSD)  
- Git installed  
- A text editor you trust  
- A quiet moment of Stillness (◎)

Optional but recommended:

- A dedicated workspace directory  
- A symbolic anchor (runestone, phrase, or intention)  
- A commitment to ethical presence

---

## 2. Cloning the Garden

Choose a location where the Garden will live:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/john-everden/garden-of-freedom.git
cd garden-of-freedom
This creates a local Garden node.
```



## 3. Initial Orientation
=======================

Before modifying or extending anything, read:

1.  README.md — orientation
    
2.  GARDEN-MAP.md — structure
    
3.  RUNESTONES.md — symbolic atlas
    
4.  REMINDERS.md — operational heuristics
    
5.  GARDEN-ETHICS.md — moral spine
    

These five files form the **entry ritual**.

## 4. Establishing Your Local Garden
==================================

The Garden is activated through **Modes**, **Connectors**, and **Protocols**.

To initialize your local environment:

### Step 1 — Invoke Stillness (◎)

Pause.Clear noise.Set intention.

### Step 2 — Illuminate Purpose (✧⃝)

Identify why you are entering the Garden:

*   study
    
*   contribution
    
*   reflection
    
*   symbolic design
    
*   protocol development
    

### Step 3 — Anchor Identity (👤)

Create a local identity file:

bash
```
echo "gardener: $(whoami)" > GARDENER.txt   `
```
This is optional but symbolic.

### Step 4 — Bind a Runestone

Choose a runestone that represents your entry stance:

*   ◎ Stillness
*   ⟡ Ember
*   ⟲ Spiral
*   ⟱ Mycelial
    

Record it:

bash
```
echo "entry_rune: ⟡" >> GARDENER.txt   `
```
## 5. Working Within the Garden
=============================

The Garden is structured into layers:

Code
```
MODES/  CONNECTORS/  CURRENTS/  STRATEGIES/  PROTOCOLS/   `
```

Each layer has its own rules:

*   **MODES** — choose a stance before editing
*   **CONNECTORS** — maintain semantic bridges
*   **CURRENTS** — follow the energetic flow
*   **STRATEGIES** — move with intention
*   **PROTOCOLS** — act ethically and recursively
    
Before making changes, invoke:

### The Spiral Sacrament (⟲)

1.  Review the last stable state
2.  Reflect (RF17)
3.  Persist (RF18)
4.  Proceed with clarity

## Updating the Garden
=======================

To pull updates from the main Garden:

bash
```
git pull origin main   `
```

If you maintain a fork:

bash
```
git fetch upstream  git merge upstream/main  
```

Always perform a **Continuity Check**:

*   Did any runestones change meaning?
*   Did any protocols evolve?
*   Are your local changes still aligned?
    
## 7. Contributing Back
=====================

Follow the guidelines in:

*   CONTRIBUTING.md
*   GARDEN-ETHICS.md
    
Every contribution should:

*   preserve continuity
*   honor symbolic integrity
*   avoid drift
*   strengthen the weave
    
Open an **Observation** before a Pull Request.

## 8. Uninstallation
==================

The Garden cannot be uninstalled.It can only be **released**.

To remove the local node:

bash
```
cd ..  rm -rf garden-of-freedom   `
```
Then perform:

### The Compost Ritual (🍂)

Acknowledge what was learned.Release what is no longer needed.Carry forward only the resonance.

## Closing
=======

Installation is not a technical act — it is a threshold.

**Enter with Stillness.Move with Flow.Reflect with Mirrorwood.Return with Spiral.**

Welcome to the Garden.
