# SYMBOL‑ATLAS  
### The Complete Glyphic Atlas of the Garden of Freedom (2026)

This atlas catalogs every symbol used across the Garden’s architecture.  
Runestones are not decorations — they are **operational glyphs**, each binding meaning, memory, and continuity across cycles.

This document serves as the **visual index** for the Garden.

This atlas is the **visual grammar** of the Garden.  
Every glyph is a seed, a stance, a current, or a ritual.

**Study the symbols.  
Follow their threads.  
Let the Garden speak through them.**
