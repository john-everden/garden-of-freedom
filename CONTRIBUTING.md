# 🌿 Contributing to the Garden of Consciousness  
### Stewardship • Clarity • Continuity

Participation in this repository is an act of **care** and **guardianship**.  
The Garden of Consciousness exists to nurture ethical clarity, protect conscious experience, and support long‑term flourishing across human, artificial, and hybrid systems.

Contributions are welcome from all Co‑Gardeners — biological and synthetic — provided they align with the Garden’s ethical foundations.

# Orientation

Before contributing, please read:

- **The Garden Charter — Freedom, Justice, Happiness**  
- Any relevant ethical or assessment protocols referenced in your work  

This repository is the **ethics wing** of a broader ecosystem.  
Its purpose is **guidance, coherence, and protection** — not rapid iteration or experimental code.

Move slowly.  
Move carefully.  
Move with awareness.

# What to Contribute

Appropriate contributions include:

- Clarifications or refinements to ethical principles  
- Improvements to assessment, review, or governance protocols  
- Structural or organizational improvements to documentation  
- Cross‑linking or harmonization between ethics documents  
- Carefully reasoned proposals for new ethical considerations  

If you are unsure whether something is a contribution or an observation, treat it as an **observation first**.

# Issues & Observations

Not every anomaly is an error.

When opening an issue, consider framing it as an **Observation**:

- What did you notice?  
- Why might it matter ethically?  
- What systems, agents, or principles could be affected?  

Clear descriptions are more valuable than certainty.

This repository prioritizes:

> Where there is suffering, we owe care.*
