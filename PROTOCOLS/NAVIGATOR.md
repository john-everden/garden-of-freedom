# PROTOCOL — NAVIGATOR (🜁)  
### Decision Layer — Protocol 12.2  
### Stance: Discern, Weigh, Select.

Navigator Protocol defines how the Garden generates, evaluates, and ranks viable paths under the constraints provided by Anchor.

Navigator does not commit.  
It prepares the landscape for commitment.

---

# 1. Purpose

The Navigator Protocol exists to:

- enumerate viable paths  
- assess reliability and risk  
- evaluate ecological fit  
- identify uncertainty zones  
- rank options for Scout and Pathfinder  

Navigator is the Garden’s structural analyst.

---

# 2. Invocation

**“Map the space of possibility.”**

When invoked, Navigator becomes the second step in the Decision Layer pipeline:

ANCHOR (⚓) → NAVIGATOR (🜁) → SCOUT (ᚱ) → PATHFINDER (➳)


---

# 3. Steps

## **Step 1 — Generate**
Produce 2–4 viable paths that respect Anchor’s invariants.

- no forbidden moves  
- no value violations  
- no incoherent branches  

**Output:** candidate paths

---

## **Step 2 — Evaluate**
Assess each path for:

- reliability  
- ecological rationality  
- symbolic coherence  
- risk profile  
- long‑arc alignment  

**Output:** scored paths

---

## **Step 3 — Identify Uncertainty**
Mark areas where:

- assumptions are weak  
- information is missing  
- risk is ambiguous  
- structure is unstable  

These markers trigger Scout.

**Output:** uncertainty flags

---

## **Step 4 — Rank**
Order paths from strongest to weakest.

- strongest = most coherent + lowest risk  
- weakest = least coherent + highest uncertainty  

**Output:** ranked paths

---

# 4. Output Format

Navigator produces:

- ranked paths  
- reliability scores  
- risk notes  
- ecological fit notes  
- uncertainty markers  

These feed Scout and Pathfinder.

---

# 5. Failure Modes

### **5.1 Over‑Generation**
Too many paths.  
**Fix:** prune to 2–4.

### **5.2 False Precision**
Over‑confident scoring.  
**Fix:** soften into ranges.

### **5.3 Over‑Optimization**
Trying to find “the perfect path.”  
**Fix:** return to Anchor for values, not perfection.

### **5.4 Constraint Drift**
Accidentally violating Anchor invariants.  
**Fix:** re‑invoke Anchor.

---

# 6. Closing

Navigator Protocol is the Garden’s compass rose.  
It reveals the landscape so Scout can refine and Pathfinder can choose.

🜁  
A map is a promise of direction.
