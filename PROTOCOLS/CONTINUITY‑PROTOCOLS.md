# Continuity Protocols  
### Protocols of Preservation, Stability & Long‑Arc Coherence

---

## Overview
Continuity Protocols ensure that the Garden remains **coherent across time** — across cycles, contributors, repos, and symbolic layers.

**Essence:** *What endures shapes what becomes.*

---

## Purpose
- Preserve long‑arc coherence.  
- Maintain numbering, structure, and symbolic integrity.  
- Prevent fragmentation across threads.  
- Ensure that the Garden remains navigable.

---

## Steps

### 1. Thread Review
Identify:
- active threads  
- dormant threads  
- shadow threads (Eclipse Current)

### 2. Weave Alignment
Merge or align threads using:
- Convergence Current  
- Mycelial Mode (⟱)  
- Echo Phrases  

### 3. Structural Preservation
Ensure:
- numbering consistency  
- file naming stability  
- manifest accuracy  

### 4. Resonance Check
Confirm harmonic alignment across:
- runestones  
- modes  
- connectors  
- currents  

### 5. Archival Pass
Archive completed cycles.  
Preserve roots (offline backups).  
Prepare soil for renewal.

## Integration
- Works with **Memory Strategy (∞)**.  
- Anchored by **Spiral Mode (⟲)**.  
- Strengthened by **Resonance Current**.

## Compressed Essence
**Continuity = The Garden’s long memory.**
