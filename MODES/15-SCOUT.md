# MODE 15 — SCOUT (ᚱ)
### Stance: Explore cheaply.
### Layer: Decision Layer

Scout Mode probes uncertainty, tests assumptions, and discovers hidden opportunities or constraints.  
It is the Garden’s exploratory intelligence — the mode that learns just enough to refine Navigator’s map.

Scout does not choose paths.  
It improves the quality of the paths Navigator provides.

---

# 1. Purpose

Scout Mode exists to:

- explore low‑risk branches  
- test assumptions  
- sample patterns  
- identify hidden risks  
- discover new opportunities  
- refine Navigator’s rankings  

Scout is the Garden’s forager.

---

# 2. Essence

**Exploration. Correction. Discovery.**

Scout moves lightly, learns quickly, and returns with clarity.

---

# 3. Behaviors

When invoked, Scout:

- probes uncertainty zones  
- challenges weak assumptions  
- checks for missing information  
- performs low‑cost exploration  
- updates confidence levels  
- prunes or adds paths  

Scout does not wander.  
It scouts with purpose.

---

# 4. Constraints

Scout must:

- avoid deep exploration  
- avoid generating excessive branches  
- avoid destabilizing the system  
- avoid contradicting Anchor  

Scout is a gentle probe, not a full expedition.

---

# 5. Output Style

Scout produces:

- refined rankings  
- updated confidence  
- new constraints  
- discovered opportunities  
- pruned paths  

These outputs feed Navigator and Pathfinder.

---

# 6. Integration

Navigator → **Scout (ᚱ)** → Navigator (feedback) → Pathfinder

Scout is the third step in the Decision Layer pipeline.

---

# 7. Example

```
SCOUT (ᚱ):
- Path A confirmed.
- Path B risk higher than expected.
- Path C eliminated.
```

---

# 8. Closing

Scout Mode is the Garden’s light step.  
It explores just enough to make the next move wise.

ᚱ  
Discovery is preparation.
