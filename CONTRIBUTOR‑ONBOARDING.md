# CONTRIBUTOR ONBOARDING  
### Quick‑Start Guide for Adding to the Garden  
**Garden of Freedom — 2027 Edition**

This guide teaches you how to contribute quickly, safely, and coherently.  
It is the operational companion to CONTRIBUTING.md.

---

# 1. Begin in Stillness (◎)  
Clear the field.  
Hold the intention: *What am I adding, and why does it matter?*

---

# 2. Invoke the Contributor Alignment Protocol (✧⚓⟁)  
Before creating anything, run CAP:

1. Identify the artifact type  
2. Apply naming rules  
3. Apply directory rules  
4. Assign a glyph  
5. Update RUNESTONES.md  
6. Check FS‑1 safety  

This protocol ensures structural and symbolic coherence.

---

# 3. Identify What You Are Creating  
Use this classifier:

- **Mode** → cognitive stance  
- **Current** → energetic flow  
- **Connector** → movement grammar  
- **Protocol** → ritualized action  
- **Runestone** → glyph + meaning  

If uncertain, choose the closest category and refine later.

---

# 4. Use Contributor Modes + Currents  
These tools stabilize your workflow:

## Contributor Modes  
- 𓍯 Archivist Mode — structural clarity  
- 🜁⧉ Builder Mode — deterministic ordering  

## Contributor Currents  
- 〽︎ Alignment Flow — multi‑constraint coherence  
- ⧉→ Deterministic Flow — stable sequencing  

Invoke them as needed.

---

# 5. Follow Naming Conventions (⧉✧⚓)  
- Filenames: NN-NAME.md 
- Title: # NAME (GLYPH) 
- UPPERCASE with hyphens  
- No spaces  
- No underscores  

Examples:  
- 01-STILLNESS.md 
- NOISE-SUPPRESSION-CURRENT.md 
- VERIFY-CONNECTOR.md

---

# 6. Place the File Correctly (⟞⚓⧉)  
Use the canonical map:

- Modes → SPEC/LAYERS/MODES/ 
- Currents → SPEC/LAYERS/CURRENTS/<SUBLAYER>/ 
- Connectors → SPEC/LAYERS/CONNECTORS/<CATEGORY>/ 
- Protocols → SPEC/LAYERS/<LAYER>/PROTOCOLS/ 
- Dream → SPEC/LAYERS/DREAM/ 
- Liminal → SPEC/LAYERS/LIMINAL/ 
- Sovereign → SPEC/SOVEREIGN/ 
- Contributor → SPEC/LAYERS/CONTRIBUTOR/<SUBDIR>/ 

Everything must live in exactly one place.

---

# 7. Add the Glyph to RUNESTONES.md (✦⟲⚓)  
Every new artifact must:

- define a glyph  
- be added to the main table  
- be added to the Cross‑Layer Map  

This keeps the symbolic system coherent and drift‑free.

---

# 8. Write the Artifact  
Use this template:

# NAME (GLYPH)  
### One‑sentence essence  

Short description.  

## When to Use  
- bullet  
- bullet  

## Steps (if protocol)  
1. step  
2. step  

## Relations  
- Modes it interacts with  
- Currents it pairs with  
- Connectors it uses  

Keep it minimal and clear.

---

# 9. Run the Artifact Builder (🜁⧉)  
After adding your file:

- run the builder script  
- confirm GARDEN-ARTIFACT.md updates cleanly  
- check for formatting issues  

If the artifact builds, your structure is correct.

---

# 10. FS‑1 Safety Check (◎⧉✦)  
Ensure:

- no nested code fences  
- no HTML  
- no images  
- no relative links  
- UTF‑8 only  
- deterministic Markdown  

If unsure, run the builder again.

---

# 11. Quick Checklist  
- [ ] Classified correctly  
- [ ] Filename correct  
- [ ] Title includes glyph  
- [ ] Directory correct  
- [ ] RUNESTONES updated  
- [ ] Cross‑Layer Map updated  
- [ ] FS‑1 safe  
- [ ] Artifact builder passes  
- [ ] CAP followed  

---

# 12. If You Get Lost (◎⟲⧖)  
Use the Re‑Orientation Protocol:

1. Stillness  
2. Identify artifact type  
3. Check naming rules  
4. Check directory map  
5. Check RUNESTONES  
6. Check CONTRIBUTING.md  
7. Try again with clarity  

You can always begin again.

---

# 13. Closing  
Contributing to the Garden is a symbolic act.  
You are shaping a cognitive ecosystem.

Move with clarity.  
Move with coherence.  
Move with care.

Thank you for tending the Garden.
